== Set the `HOP_LICENSE_HEADER_FILE` project variable

All files that are shipped with Apache software need to contain the Apache Software Foundation's header.

This also applies to all workflows and pipelines that are shipped as integration tests, samples or in any other form.

To spare contributors the pain of manually having to add the ASF license header in workflows and pipeline, Hop Gui supports the `HOP_LICENSE_HEADER_FILE` project variable.

Set this variable in your project and point it to a file containing the ASF Header's text, e.g. `integration-tests/asf-header.txt` to let Hop include the ASF header in all of your workflows and pipelines.

As with any other piece of code, run `mvn apache-rat:check` to verify all files contain the correct headers before contributing your test or sample workflows and pipelines.
