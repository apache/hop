== Methods to use

=== EnvironmentUtils.getInstance().isWeb() to see if the client is a web browser instead of a desktop app.

== Methods to avoid

=== Display.getDefault() is not allowed

See https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/805303/

____
RAP is multi user framework by its nature.
Every user session is associated with a display.
In RAP, Display#getDefault() will not create a new display when it's called from non-UI thread - read Display#getDefault JavaDoc.
When you execute a code in a background thread, RAP needs to know for which UI session (display) it belongs.
That's why you have to provide the correct UISession/display from outside.

[source,java]
----
Display.getDefault() cannot be used in non-UI thread with RAP/RWT.

=== SWT.CASCADE without submenu does not work

See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=569046

____
A menuitem with SWT.CASCADE without a submenu looks and behaves differently from SWT.

SWT:

- The menuitem does not have a right arrow on the right hand of the menu text.
- The menuitem is clickable.

RWT:

- The menuitem has a right arrow.
- The menuitem is NOT clickable.
____

=== CTabFolder.setSimple() is not allowed

This method is not implemented in RAP/RWT.

== Themes

Hop Web now has 2 themes implemented: "light" and "dark".
They are selected with the system environment variable `HOP_WEB_THEME` which you can pass to a docker container using `--env HOP_WEB_THEME=dark`.
The default theme is `light`

To change a theme you need to look in 2 different locations:

=== CSS

The colors of the various widgets, windows, the icons used and so on are defined in css files:

* For the dark theme: `rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/dark-mode.css`
* For the light theme: `rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/light-mode.css`

The Eclipse RAP theming reference is found https://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/doc/3.17/guide/reference/theming/index.html[here].

=== JS

When icons are moved, lassoed and so on we have a bit of JavaScript taking care of those operations.
You can find the relevant files handling that over here:

* For the dark theme: `rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/canvas-dark.js`
* For the light theme: `rap/src/main/resources/org/apache/hop/ui/hopgui/canvas-light.js`

== Building the Hop Web docker container

If you have built the project using `mvn clean install` you can build a local `hop-web` docker container to test with the following script:

`docker/create_hop_web_container.sh`

NOTE: You can also do this incrementally for the following modules:

* core
* engine
* ui
* rap

If you rebuild any of these modules after changes you can simply run `docker/create_hop_web_container.sh` and this script it will incorporate your changes in the container.

To then run it simply execute:

`docker run -p 8080:8080 -e HOP_WEB_THEME=dark hop-web`

== Configuring Hop Web

The main configuration of Hop is done through a single configuration file called `hop-config.json` and it is found in folder `${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}`

It is possible to set pass this standard Hop environment variable `HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER` to the docker container.
You can point it to a mounted volume for example:

`docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /host/path/to/config:/config -e HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER=/config hop-web`

In the same way you can set the standard variable `HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER` to store GUI auditing and logging information.
