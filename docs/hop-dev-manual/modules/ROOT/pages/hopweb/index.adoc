== Building or customizing Hop Web

Building and setting up your own Hop Web environment is straightforward.

The steps to set up the default Docker image are included in a helper script `docker/create_hop_web_container.sh` in the Hop code base.
This should get you started to make modifications or create your own version entirely.

[source,bash]
----
#set working dir to current location
cd "${0%/*}"

#unzip files for docker image
unzip ../assemblies/web/target/hop.war -d ../assemblies/web/target/webapp
unzip ../assemblies/plugins/dist/target/hop-assemblies-*.zip -d ../assemblies/plugins/dist/target/

#build docker image
docker build ../ -f Dockerfile.web -t hop-web

#cleanup
rm -rf ../assemblies/web/target/webapp
rm -rf ../assemblies/plugins/dist/target/plugins
