:description: Building and setting up your own Hop Web environment is straightforward. The steps to set up the default Docker image are included in a helper script docker/create_hop_web_container.sh in the Hop code base. This should get you started to make modifications or create your own version entirely.

= Hop Web Development Guide

== Building or customizing Hop Web

Hop Web is available as a Docker container image from Docker Hub. Check the xref:manual::hop-gui/hop-web.adoc[user manual for Hop Web] for more information.


== Build Hop

Hop currently doesn't offer any standalone Hop Web builds.

Running your own Hop Web environment is straightforward but requires you to build Hop. Follow the xref:setup-dev-environment.adoc[development environment setup] guide to get the Hop source code and build Hop.

== Tomcat Configuration

=== Copy files

We'll use Apache Tomcat in this example. If you use another application server, the process should be similar.

Hop 1.x is built with Java 8, so you'll need to https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi[download the latest Tomcat 9].

The steps to set up the default Docker image are included in a helper script `docker/create_hop_web_container.sh` in the Hop code base.
This should get you started to make modifications or create your own version entirely.

Copy or extract the following files from your Hop build, where `$CATALINA_HOME` is your Tomcat installation folder.

[source,bash]
----

#unzip files for docker image
unzip assemblies/web/target/hop.war -d $CATALINA_HOME/webapp
unzip assemblies/plugins/dist/target/hop-assemblies-*.zip -d $CATALINA_HOME/
----

=== Modify startup script

Configure Tomcat to run Hop by adding the information below to  `$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh`, anywhere before the last line (`exec "$PRGDIR"/"$EXECUTABLE" start "$@"`)

[source,bash]
----

HOP_AES_ENCODER_KEY=
# specify where Hop should store audit information
HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER="${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/hop/audit"
# specify where Hop should manage configuration metadata (e.g. projects and environments information).
HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER="${CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/hop/config"
# specify the hop log level
HOP_LOG_LEVEL="Basic"
# any additional JRE settings you want to pass on
#HOP_OPTIONS=
# default Hop password encoder plugin
HOP_PASSWORD_ENCODER_PLUGIN="Hop"
# point Hop to the plugins folder
HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS="plugins"
# path to jdbc drivers
HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDER=
# the theme to use (dark or light)
HOP_WEB_THEME="light"

# Set TOMCAT start variables
export CATALINA_OPTS='${HOP_OPTIONS} -DHOP_AES_ENCODER_KEY="${HOP_AES_ENCODER_KEY}" -DHOP_AUDIT_FOLDER="${HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER}" -DHOP_CONFIG_FOLDER="${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}" -DHOP_LOG_LEVEL="${HOP_LOG_LEVEL}" -DHOP_PASSWORD_ENCODER_PLUGIN="${HOP_PASSWORD_ENCODER_PLUGIN}" -DHOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS="${HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS}" -DHOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDER="${HOP_SHARED_JDBC_FOLDER}" -DHOP_WEB_THEME="${HOP_WEB_THEME}"'

----

If you want to run Hop Web with the `default` and `samples` projects, make sure the project root path in `hop-config.json` is set to `${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}.

On Linux or Mac, use the following sed command to fix this in one line:

`sed -i 's/config\/projects/${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}\/projects/g' webapps/hop/config/hop-config.json`

On Windows, modify `hop-config.json` to make sure `projectsConf` looks like the one below:

[source, json]
----
  "projectsConfig" : {
    "enabled" : true,
    "projectMandatory" : true,
    "defaultProject" : "default",
    "standardParentProject" : "default",
    "projectConfigurations" : [ {
      "projectName" : "default",
      "projectHome" : "${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}/projects/default",
      "configFilename" : "project-config.json"
    }, {
      "projectName" : "samples",
      "projectHome" : "${HOP_CONFIG_FOLDER}/projects/samples",
      "configFilename" : "project-config.json"
    } ]
  }

----

== Start Tomcat

Run `bin/startup.sh` (Linux/Mac) or `bin/startup.bat` (Windows).

Hop Web should only take a couple of seconds to start.

Access through http://localhost:8080/hop/ui to test.
