= The Hop SDK

== Initializing

First, we need to initialize the Hop API.
This means we load configuration details, search for and load plugins and so on.

You can do this with:

[source,java]
----
HopEnvironment.init();
----

== Plugin folders

If you need to load plugins from different folders you can set system property `HOP_PLUGIN_BASE_FOLDERS`.
The default value is `plugins`, the relative path to the installation folder plugins folder.
You can add your own plugin folders with commas (`,`) separating the values.

== Hop Metadata Providers

Shared metadata in Hop is handled by a HopMetadataProvider.
When using the Hop GUI you store it in a project in the ```metadata/``` folder.
In that case you can point to such a folder with class ```JsonMetadataProvider```.
Note that you can serialize such a metadata collection into a single JSON string using ```SerializableMetadataProvider```.
This can be used to send metadata to remote servers and locations.

When you have a provider you can ask it to give you a serializer with which you can add and retrieve all sorts of metadata objects.

== Variables

If you want to work with variables in your pipelines and workflows it makes sense to create a top level IVariables object.
The easiest way to do this is with:

[source,java]
----
IVariables variables = Variables.getADefaultVariableSpace();
----

This method also takes into account variables which are configured in hop-config.json (if that file can be found);

== Pipelines

=== Loading pipeline metadata from a file

You can get the pipeline metadata from a `.hpl` XML file using:

[source,java]
----
PipelineMeta pipelineMeta = new PipelineMeta(
  "path-to-your-filename.hpl",   // The filename
  metadataProvider,             // See above
  true,                        // set internal variables
  variables                   // see above
);
----

=== Loading pipeline metadata from an input stream

[source,java]
----
PipelineMeta pipelineMeta = new PipelineMeta(
  inputStream,         // The stream to load from
  metadataProvider,   // See above
  true,              // set internal variables
  variables         // see above
);
----

=== Construct pipeline metadata with the Hop API

Obviously you can start with an empty pipeline and add the transforms, hops you like:

[source,java]
----
PipelineMeta pipelineMeta = new PipelineMeta();

// Generate 1M empty rows
//
RowGeneratorMeta rowGeneratorMeta = new RowGeneratorMeta();
rowGeneratorMeta.setRowLimit("1000000");

TransformMeta rowGenerator = new TransformMeta("1M", rowGeneratorMeta);
rowGenerator.setLocation(50, 50);
pipelineMeta.addTransform(rowGenerator);

// Just a dummy placeholder for testing
//
DummyMeta dummyMeta = new DummyMeta();
TransformMeta dummy = new TransformMeta("Output", dummyMeta);
dummy.setLocation(250, 50);
pipelineMeta.addTransform(dummy);

// Add a hop between both
//
PipelineHopMeta generatorDummyHop = new PipelineHopMeta(rowGenerator, dummy);
pipelineMeta.addPipelineHop(generatorDummyHop);

----

=== Pipeline execution

The way a pipeline is executed depends on the run configuration you specify.
To make it easy to get the engine we created a factory for you:

[source,java]
----
IPipelineEngine pipelineEngine = PipelineEngineFactory.createPipelineEngine(
  variables,           // see above
  "local",            // The name of the run configuration defined in the metadata
  metadataProvider,  // The metadata provider to resolve the run configuration details
  pipelineMeta      // The pipeline metadata
);

// We can now simply execute this engine...
//
pipelineEngine.execute();

// This execution runs in the background but we can wait for it to finish:
//
pipelineEngine.waitUnitlFinished();

// When it's done we can evalute the results:
//
Result result = pipelineEngine.getResult();

----

=== Injecting data into a pipeline

You can only inject data into a `LocalPipelineEngine`.
Do so using the `addRowProducer`.
Call this method after your run `prepareExecution()` so that the row producer can be attached to the correct transform copy.
After starting the execution of the pipeline you can then use the `RowProducer` to put rows into the pipeline using `putRow()`.
Make sure to call `setFinished()` when you're done feeding rows into the pipeline.

=== Retrieving rows from a pipeline

This again is only supported on the local pipeline engine `LocalPipelineEngine`.
After `prepareExecution()` you can add row listeners to the various transforms:

[source,java]
----
ITransform transform = localPipeline.findTransformInterface("transform-name", 0);
transform.addRowListener(new RowAdapter() {
  void rowWrittenEvent( IRowMeta rowMeta, Object[] row ) throws HopTransformException {
    // A row was written during execution
  }
});
----

== Workflows

=== Loading workflow metadata from a file

You can get the workflow metadata from a `.hwf` XML file using:

[source,java]
----
WorkflowMeta workflowMeta = new WorkflowMeta(
  variables,                     // see above
  "path-to-your-filename.hwf",  // The filename
  metadataProvider             // See above
);
----

=== Loading workflow metadata from an input stream

[source,java]
----
WorkflowMeta workflowMeta = new WorkflowMeta(
  inputStream,                   // the inputstream to read the metadata from
  metadataProvider,             // See above
  variables                    // see above
);
----

=== Construct workflow metadata with the Hop API

You typically start with an empty workflow and then add the actions and hops you want:

[source,java]
----
WorkflowMeta workflowMeta = new WorkflowMeta();

// Add the Start action
//
ActionStart actionStart = new ActionStart("Start");
ActionMeta startMeta = new ActionMeta(actionStart);
startMeta.setLocation(50, 50);
workflowMeta.addAction(startMeta);

// Just a dummy placeholder for testing
//
ActionDummy actionDummy = new ActionDummy("Dummy");
ActionMeta dummyMeta = new ActionMeta(dummyMeta);
dummyMeta.setLocation(250, 50);
workflowMeta.addAction(dummyMeta);

// Add a hop between both
//
WorkflowHopMeta startDummyHop = new WorkflowHopMeta(startMeta, dummyMeta);
workflowMeta.addWorkflowHop(generatorDummyHop);

----

=== Workflow execution

Workflow engines are also plugins.
Which plugin is used to execute your workflow metadata is specified in a xref:manual::workflow/workflow-run-configurations/workflow-run-configurations.adoc[Workflow Run Configuration].

To make it easy to get the engine we created a factory for you:

[source,java]
----
IWorkflowEngine workflowEngine = WorkflowEngineFactory.createWorkflowEngine(
  variables,           // see above
  "local",            // The name of the run configuration defined in the metadata
  metadataProvider,  // The metadata provider to resolve the run configuration details
  workflowMeta,     // The workflow metadata
  parentLogging    // The parent logging object
);

// We can now execute this engine...
// This execution does not run in the background.
// When you get the result, the execution has completed.
//
Result result = workflowEngine.startExecution();
