= Hop User Manual

The Apache Hop (Incubating) User Manual contains all the information you need to develop and deploy data solutions with Apache Hop.

We've listed a number of starting points that might find useful to you. Check the full list of topics on the left hand side.
If you're a developer and want to extend Hop, want to build new functionality or want to fix a bug you found, check the http://hop.apache.org/dev-manual/latest/[developer documentation]

TIP: Hop treats documentation as any other part of software that can have bugs or missing features. If you find any incorrect information or are missing a crucial piece of documentation, please http://hop.apache.org/community/contribution-guides/jira-guide/[create a JIRA ticket].
