= Hop File Dialog

The Hop File Dialog is a versatile tool you'll use often while working in Hop Gui.

This dialog offers a lot more than basically selecting and saving files. Among other things, it enables you to work with VFS file sytems directly, provides file/folder information, lets you bookmark files and folders.

The list below walks you through the options that are at your disposal in the Hop File Dialog.

TIP: if you prefer your operating system's native file dialog instead of the Hop dialog, change variable `HOP_USE_NATIVE_FILE_DIALOG` to `Y` in `Tools -> Edit Config Variables`.
