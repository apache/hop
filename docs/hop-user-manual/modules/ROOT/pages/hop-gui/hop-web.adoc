:description: Hop Web is a browser based alternative for desktop Hop Gui. Hop Web offers exactly the same functionality as the desktop client, you'll hardly notice any difference.

= Hop Web

Hop Web is a web based Hop Gui version.
Hop Gui was designed from the ground up to be web-ready. You'll barely notice any difference between working in the Hop Gui _fat client_ or Hop Web.

== Getting Hop Web

Hop Web is included in the default Hop build.
With each build, an update is pushed to https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/hop-web[Docker Hub].

This continously updated docker image is by far the easiest way to try out Hop Web:

Pull the latest build with: `docker pull apache/hop-web`.

Once the image has been pulled, start Hop Web with `docker run -p 8080:8080 apache/hop-web:latest`

The Hop Web container should only take a couple of seconds to start.
Your container logs should output similar to the example below:

[source,bash]
----

2021/04/22 18:14:37 - Hop - Projects enabled
2021/04/22 18:14:37 - Hop - Enabling project : 'default'
----

Once your container has started, Hop Web is available at http://localhost:8080/ui.
You'll feel right at home!
