== Hop Server configuration

Your Hop Server needs to know about the metadata you defined.
As stated above you need to make sure the server has access to the pipeline(s) you want to execute as well as the server metadata.

The best way to do this is to set the following option in your XML configuration file:

[source,xml]
----
<metadata_folder>/path/to/your/metadata</metadata_folder>
----

A simple example would be:

[source,xml]
----
<hop-server-config>
  <hop-server>
    <name>8181</name>
    <hostname>localhost</hostname>
    <port>8181</port>
  </hop-server>
  <metadata_folder>/home/hop/project/services/metadata</metadata_folder>

</hop-server-config>
----

== Using the service

=== Base request

[source,http request]
----
http://<hop-server-url>/hop/webService
----

=== Request parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description

|`service`
|The name of the service.  This corresponds to the Web Service metadata object.

|Any parameter name
