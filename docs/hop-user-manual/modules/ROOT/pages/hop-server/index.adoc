= Hop Server

Hop Server is a lightweight server to run workflows and pipelines in the xref:pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/native-remote-pipeline-engine.adoc[Remote Native] run configuration.
Additonally, Hop Server can also be accessed directly through a number of REST services and in combination with the xref:metadata-types/web-service.adoc[Web Service] metadata type.

== Starting and Stopping Hop Server

=== General Use

Hop Server is available as a script in your Hop installation directory.

Run Hop Server without any parameters to display its usage options.
On Windows, this is `hop-server.bat`, on Mac and Linux, run `hop-server.sh`.

[source,bash]
Usage: hop-server <Interface address> <Port> [-h] [-p <arg>] [-s] [-u <arg>]
or
Usage: Hop Server <Configuration File>
Starts or stops the hopServer server.
     -h,--help               This help text
     -p,--password <arg>     The administrator password.  Required only if
                             stopping the Hop Server server.
     -s,--stop               Stop the running hopServer server.  This is only
                             allowed when using the hostname/port form of the
                             command.
     -u,--userName <arg>     The administrator user name.  Required only if
                             stopping the Hop Server server.
Example: hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080
Example: hop-server.sh 192.168.1.221 8081
Example: hop-server.sh /foo/bar/hop-server-config.xml
Example: hop-server.sh http://www.example.com/hop-server-config.xml
Example: hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080 -s -u cluster -p cluster

The available Hop Server options are:

[width="90%",options="header"]
|===
|Short|Extended|Description
|h|help|This help text
|p|password|The administrator password.
Required only if stopping the Hop Server server.
|s|stop|Stop the running hopServer server.
This is only allowed when using the hostname/port form of the command.
|u|username|The administrator user name.
Required only if stopping the Hop Server server.
|===

=== Start Hop Server with command line parameters

Hop Server can be started with hostname or ip address and port number as unnamed arguments:

[source,shell]
hop-server <Interface address> <Port> [-h] [-p <arg>] [-s] [-u <arg>]

Example startup commands are:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 192.168.1.221 8081

=== Start Hop Server with a configuration file

Specify the xml configuration file as the only argument:

[source,shell]
hop-server <Configuration File>

The syntax of this configuration file is fairly simple:

[source,xml]
----
<hop-server-config>

  <hop-server>
    <name>server-8181</name>
    <hostname>localhost</hostname>
    <port>8181</port>
  </hop-server>

  <!-- Join the web server thread and wait until it's finished.
       The default is true
  -->
  <joining>true</joining>

  <!-- The maximum number of log lines kept in memory by the server.
       The default is 0 which means: keep all lines
   -->
  <max_log_lines>0</max_log_lines>

  <!-- The time (in minutes) it takes for a log line to be cleaned up in memory.
       The default is 0 which means: never clean up log lines
  -->
  <max_log_timeout_minutes>1440</max_log_timeout_minutes>

  <!-- The time (in minutes) it takes for a pipeline or workflow execution to be removed from the server status.
       The default is 0 which means: never clean executions
  -->
  <object_timeout_minutes>1440</object_timeout_minutes>

  <!-- The folder to read metadata objects from so that web services and database connections for sequences can be found.
       The default is that no metadata is configured: remotely executed pipelines and workflows will have their own metadata.
  -->
  <metadata_folder></metadata_folder>

</hop-server-config>
----

Example startup commands with a configuration file are:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh /foo/bar/hop-server-config.xml

Or with a remote configuration file:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh http://www.example.com/hop-server-config.xml

=== Stopping Hop Server

In a testing setup where Hop Server was started from a terminal, the process can be terminated through `CTRL-C`.

In headless environments, the same hop-server command used to start the server can be used to stop it:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080 -s -u cluster -p cluster

== Verify startup

Starting a Hop Server on the local machine e.g. on port 8081 will only take 1 or 2 seconds.

The console output will look similar to what is listed below:

[source,shell]
2020/06/20 18:35:12 - HopServer - Installing timer to purge stale objects after 1440 minutes.
2020/06/20 18:35:12 - HopServer - Created listener for webserver @ address : localhost:8081

== Connect to the Hop Server UI

To connect to the previously started server, point your browser to `http://localhost:8081`.

You'll be prompted for your username and password.
The default is `cluster` for both the username and password.
The defaults obviously should be changed in any environment that goes beyond a simple local developer setup.

TIP: on startup, the pipeline and workflow lists shown below will be empty.
Run a workflow or pipeline through the xref:pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/native-remote-pipeline-engine.adoc[Hop Remote pipeline engine] run configuration or through the xref:metadata-types/web-service.adoc[REST api].
When pipelines or workflows are executed on the server, you'll be able to follow the logging output either from the terminal or a log file (e.g. piped from the startup command).

image::hop-server/hop-server-status.png[Hop Server Status,width="65%"]

For each of the options in the pipeline and workflow dialogs described below, select a pipeline and workflow from the list and select the desired option.

The header bar for workflows and pipelines is almost identical (from left to right).

|Run|
|Stop the running pipeline/workflow|
|Cleanup pipeline|Cleanup a pipeline: close remote sockets etc
|View pipeline/workflow details|
|Remove pipeline/workflow from list|
