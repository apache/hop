= Hop Server

Hop Server is a lightweight server to run workflows and pipelines in the xref:pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/native-remote-pipeline-engine.adoc[Remote Native] run configuration.
Additionally, Hop Server can also be accessed directly through a number of web services and in combination with the xref:hop-server/web-service.adoc[Web Service] and xref:hop-server/async-web-service.adoc[Asynchronous Web Service] metadata types.

== Starting and Stopping Hop Server

=== General Use

Hop Server is available as a script in your Hop installation directory.

Run Hop Server without any parameters to display its usage options.
On Windows, this is `hop-server.bat`, on Mac and Linux, run `hop-server.sh`.

[source,bash]

=== Start Hop Server with command line parameters

Hop Server can be started with hostname or ip address and port number as unnamed arguments:

[source,shell]
hop-server <Interface address> <Port> [-h] [-p <arg>] [-s] [-u <arg>]

Example startup commands are:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 192.168.1.221 8081

Listen to all interfaces on the server:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 0.0.0.0 8080

=== Start Hop Server with a configuration file

Specify the xml configuration file as the only argument:

[source,shell]
hop-server <Configuration File>

The syntax of this configuration file is fairly simple:

[source,xml]
----
<hop-server-config>

  <hop-server>
    <name>server-8181</name>
    <hostname>localhost</hostname>
    <port>8181</port>
  </hop-server>

  <!-- Join the web server thread and wait until it's finished.
       The default is true
  -->
  <joining>true</joining>

  <!-- The maximum number of log lines kept in memory by the server.
       The default is 0 which means: keep all lines
   -->
  <max_log_lines>0</max_log_lines>

  <!-- The time (in minutes) it takes for a log line to be cleaned up in memory.
       The default is 0 which means: never clean up log lines
  -->
  <max_log_timeout_minutes>1440</max_log_timeout_minutes>

  <!-- The time (in minutes) it takes for a pipeline or workflow execution to be removed from the server status.
       The default is 0 which means: never clean executions
  -->
  <object_timeout_minutes>1440</object_timeout_minutes>

  <!-- The folder to read metadata objects from so that web services and database connections for sequences can be found.
       The default is that no metadata is configured: remotely executed pipelines and workflows will have their own metadata.
  -->
  <metadata_folder></metadata_folder>

</hop-server-config>
----

Example startup commands with a configuration file are:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh /foo/bar/hop-server-config.xml

Or with a remote configuration file:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh http://www.example.com/hop-server-config.xml

You can also enable a project lifecyfle environment for the Hop server:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh -e graph-aws hop-server.xml

In the sample above the environment contains configuration files with variables which are loaded.
With the environment the server also knows the project home folder.
The server configuration file is found in the home folder automatically with the implicit relative path.

=== SSL configuration

To run the Hop server using the `https://` protocol you can add an `sslConfig` section in the `hop-server-config/hop-server` path.
The 3 main options are:

* `keyStore` : the path to the java keystore file, created with `keytool`
* `keyStorePassword` : the password to the keystore file
* `keyPassword` : the key password.
If this is the same as the keystore password you can omit this option.

Example:
[source,xml]

----
<hop-server-config>
  <hop-server>
    ...

    <sslConfig>
      <keyStore>/path/to/keystore.jks</keyStore>
      <keyStorePassword>password</keyStorePassword>
      <keyPassword>anotherPassword</keyPassword>
    </sslConfig>

  </hop-server>
  ...
</hop-server-config>
----

=== Stopping Hop Server

In a testing setup where Hop Server was started from a terminal, the process can be terminated through `CTRL-C`.

In headless environments, the same hop-server command used to start the server can be used to stop it:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080 -s -u cluster -p cluster

== Verify startup

Starting a Hop Server on the local machine e.g. on port 8081 will only take 1 or 2 seconds.

The console output will look similar to what is listed below:

[source,shell]
2020/06/20 18:35:12 - HopServer - Installing timer to purge stale objects after 1440 minutes.
2020/06/20 18:35:12 - HopServer - Created listener for webserver @ address : localhost:8081

== Query a server from the command line

You can query the new server with another hop-server command:

[source,shell]
----
sh hop-server.sh -gs -u cluster -p cluster 127.0.0.1 8080
Pipelines: 0 found.

Workflows: 0 found.

== Connect to the Hop Server UI

To connect to the previously started server, point your browser to `http://localhost:8081`.

You'll be prompted for your username and password.
The default is `cluster` for both the username and password.
The defaults obviously should be changed in any environment that goes beyond a simple local developer setup.

TIP: on startup, the pipeline and workflow lists shown below will be empty.
Run a workflow or pipeline through the xref:pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/native-remote-pipeline-engine.adoc[Hop Remote pipeline engine] run configuration or through the xref:hop-server/web-service.adoc[REST api].
When pipelines or workflows are executed on the server, you'll be able to follow the logging output either from the terminal or a log file (e.g. piped from the startup command).

image::hop-server/hop-server-status.png[Hop Server Status,width="65%"]

For each of the options in the pipeline and workflow dialogs described below, select a pipeline and workflow from the list and select the desired option.

The header bar for workflows and pipelines is almost identical (from left to right).
