= Hop Server

Hop Server is a lightweight, Jetty-based server for https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/hop-gui/run-configurations/pipeline/remote-pipeline-engine.html[remote execution] of workflows and pipelines.

Except for remote execution, Hop Server can also be accessed directly through a number of REST services.

== Start Hop Server

Hop Server is available as a script in your Hop installation directory.

Run Hop Server without any parameters to display its usage options. On Windows, this is `hop-server.bat`, on Mac and Linux, run `hop-server.sh`.

The output you'll get is similar to what is in the screenshot below.

Hop Server takes a hostname or ip address and port number as unnamed arguments. All other arguments are named.
Alternatively, the options can be provided in a configuration XML file.
*TODO*: document XML configuration file structure.

[source,shell]
hop-server <Interface address> <Port> [-h] [-p <arg>] [-s] [-u <arg>]

or

[source,shell]
hop-server <Configuration File>

The Hop Server options are listed in detail in the table below:

[width="90%", options="header"]
|===
|Short|Extended|Description
|h|help|This help text
|p|password|The administrator password.  Required only if stopping the Hop Server server.
|s|stop|Stop the running hopServer server.  This is only allowed when using the hostname/port form of the command.
|u|username|The administrator user name.  Required only if stopping the Hop Server server.
|===


Example startup commands are:

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 192.168.1.221 8081

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh /foo/bar/hop-server-config.xml

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh http://www.example.com/hop-server-config.xml

[source,shell]
hop-server.sh 127.0.0.1 8080 -s -u cluster -p cluster

Starting a Hop Server on the local machine on port 8081 will only take 1 or 2 seconds.

The console output will look similar to what is listed below:

[source,shell]
2020/06/20 18:35:12 - HopServer - Installing timer to purge stale objects after 1440 minutes.
2020/06/20 18:35:12 - HopServer - Created listener for webserver @ address : localhost:8081

== Connect to the Hop Server UI

To connect to the previously started server, point your browser to http://localhost:8081.

You'll be prompted for your username and password. The default is `cluster` for both the username and password. The defaults obviously should be changed in any environment that goes beyond a simple local developer setup.

Click 'Show status' to move beyond the initial screen.

Since no workflows or pipelines have been executed on this server yet, the workflow and pipelines lists will be empty.
