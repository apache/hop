Hop Projects are a conceptual grouping of configurations, variables, metadata objects and workflows and pipelines.
Projects can inherit metadata from parent projects.
A project contains one or more environments where the actual configuration is defined. +
Example: a 'Sales' project contains a 'customers' database connection and a number of workflows and pipelines.
The runtime configurations, database connection properties etc are defined in the 'dev', 'uat' and 'prd' environments.
