Hop Encrypt is a command line tool that obfuscates or encrypts a plain text password for use in XML, password or metadata files.
Make sure to also copy the password encryption prefix to indicate the obfuscated nature of the password.
Hop will then be able to make the distinction between regular plain text passwords and obfuscated ones.
