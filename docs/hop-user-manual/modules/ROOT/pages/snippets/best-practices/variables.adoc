[[Variables]]
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images

xref:variables.adoc[Variables] provide an easy way to avoid hard-coding all sorts of things in your system, environment or project.
Here is some best practices advice on the subject:

* Put environment specific settings in an environment (Duh!) configuration file.
Create an environment for this.
* When referencing file locations, prefer `${PROJECT_HOME}` over expressions like `${Internal.Entry.Current.Directory}` or `${Internal.Pipeline.Filename.Directory}`
* Configure transform copies with variables to allow for easy transition between differently sized environments.
