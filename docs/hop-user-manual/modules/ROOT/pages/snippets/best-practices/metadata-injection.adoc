[[MetadataInjection]]
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images

If you find that you need to create 'almost' the same pipeline a lot of times, consider that you can use xref:pipeline/transforms/metainject.adoc[Metadata Injection] to create re-usable template pipelines.

* Avoid manual population of dialogs
* Whenever you need dynamic ETL
* Supports data streaming

Example use cases include:
* Load 50 different file formats into a database with one pipeline template * Automatically normalize and load property sets
