If you have recurring logic in various pipelines, consider writing Mapping.
It is a pipeline reading from a xref:pipeline/transforms/mapping-input.adoc[Mapping Input] and writing to a xref:pipeline/transforms/mapping-output.adoc[Mapping Output] transform.
You can re-use the work in other pipelines using the xref:pipeline/transforms/simple-mapping.adoc[Simple Mapping] transform.
