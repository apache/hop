=== Transforms and actions

When looking at a pipeline or workflow it's so much easier to see what's going on if you give meaningful names to the transforms and workflows.

For input and output files, why not use the filename you're using?

TIP: You can use any unicode character in the name of a transform or action and even newlines are allowed.

=== Metadata

When giving names to metadata objects like relational database connections, avoid environment specific words like a country, region, lifecycle environments:

Here are some examples to avoid and possible alternatives:

* Test Database -> CRM
* France MySQL -> WWW
* East Coast Cluster -> Fraud

=== Naming standard

What you can see in larger projects is that projects can become quite cluttered after a while.
Here is some advice on how to keep things tidy and clean...

* Folders can have sub-folders: organize your work with sub-folders in a project.  It's just hard to work with hundreds of pipelines and workflows in a single folder.
* Use a naming convention for any object that you need to give a name: pipelines, workflows, folders, names, tables, fields, ...
* For larger projects you should consider setting up a naming standard.  It's just a document in which you specify how you want to name things.
* Make sure to adjust, verify and enforce your naming standard periodically.  If you don't plan to do this you might was well not set up a corporate standard.
* Consider scripts and commit hooks or a nightly run on your build server (Jenkins) to validate your naming standard.
