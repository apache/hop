[[Loops]]
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images

Avoid looping in workflows.
The easiest way to loop over a set of values, rows, files, ... is to use an Executor transform.

* xref:pipeline/transforms/pipelineexecutor.adoc[Pipeline Executor] : run a pipeline for each input row
* xref:pipeline/transforms/workflowexecutor.adoc[Workflow Executor] : run a workflow for each input row

You can nicely map field values to parameters of the pipeline or workflow making loops a breeze.
