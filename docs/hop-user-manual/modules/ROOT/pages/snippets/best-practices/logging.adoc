[[Logging]]
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images

Take some time to capture the logging of your workflows and pipelines.  Any time you run anything you want to have a trace of it.  Things tend to go wrong when you least expect it and at that point you like being able to see what happened.  See xref:logging/logging-basics.adoc[Logging Basics], xref:logging/logging-reflection.adoc[Logging Reflection] or consider logging to a xref:technology/neo4j/index.adoc[Neo4j] graph database.  This last one allows you to browse the logging results in the Neo4j perspective.
