= Workflow Log

== Description

image:icons/workflow-log.svg[]

Allows to log the activity of a workflow with a pipeline.

A workflow log streams logging information from a running workflow to a pipeline.

The only requirement for the receiving pipeline is that it starts with a xref:pipeline/transforms/workflow-logging.adoc[Workflow Logging] transform. Other than that, the logging pipeline is "just another pipeline".
In this logging pipeline, you can process the logging information and e.g. write to a relational or NoSQL database, a Kafka topic etc

== Samples

The samples project comes with an example workflow log.

Check the metadata perspective for the workflow log `workflow-log-example`. This workflow log is configured to send logging information for the workflow `{openvar}PROJECT_HOME{closevar}/reflection/generate-fake-books.hwf` to the logging pipeline `{openvar}PROJECT_HOME{closevar}/reflection/workflow-log-example.hpl`.
