== Description

image:icons/pipeline-log.svg[]

Allows to log the activity of a pipeline with another pipeline.

A pipeline log streams logging information from a running pipeline to another pipeline.

The only requirement for the receiving pipeline is that it starts with a xref:pipeline/transforms/pipeline-logging.adoc[Pipeline Logging] transform. Other than that, the logging pipeline is "just another pipeline".
In this logging pipeline, you can process the logging information and e.g. write to a relational or NoSQL database, a Kafka topic etc

== Samples

The samples project comes with an example pipeline log.

Check the metadata perspective for the pipeline log `pipeline-log-example`. This pipeline log is configured to send logging information for the pipeline `{openvar}PROJECT_HOME{closevar}/reflection/generate-fake-books.hpl` to the logging pipeline `{openvar}PROJECT_HOME{closevar}/reflection/pipeline-log-example.hpl`.
