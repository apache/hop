This defines a data set, a static pre-defined collection of rows

Data sets are used in xref:metadata-types/pipeline-unit-test.adoc[unit testing], where a data set is used as an alternative input data set. This input set is used to be processed in a unit testing pipeline. After processing the result of the pipeline is compared to a data set that has been specified as the 'golden data set' for the test.
