:description: Describes a Salesforce connection. The Salesforce connection, specified on a project level, can be reused across multiple Salesforce transforms.

= Salesforce Connection

== Description

image:icons/SFI.svg[width="24px"]

Describes a Salesforce connection that can be reused across multiple Salesforce transforms.

The Salesforce Connection metadata type allows you to define connection settings once and reuse them across all Salesforce transforms in your project. This eliminates the need to duplicate connection information and provides centralized management of Salesforce authentication credentials.

== Creating Connections

=== Creating a Username/Password Connection

Follow these steps to create a Salesforce connection using username and password authentication:

1. Open the Metadata Perspective in Hop GUI
2. Navigate to Salesforce Connection in the metadata tree
3. Right-click and select "New Salesforce Connection"
4. Enter a descriptive name for your connection
5. Ensure "Username/Password" is selected as the Authentication Type
6. Fill in the required fields:
   * **Username**: Your Salesforce username or email address
   * **Password**: Your Salesforce password (or use a variable like `${SF_PASS}`)
   * **Security Token (Optional)**: Only required if your organization has IP restrictions enabled and you're connecting from an untrusted IP address. If you need a security token, you can request it from Salesforce by going to Settings > My Personal Information > Reset My Security Token
   * **Target URL**: The default `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/64.0` works for most cases. Use `https://test.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/64.0` for sandbox environments
7. Click "Test Connection" to verify your settings
8. If the test is successful, click "OK" to save the connection

NOTE: The security token is typically only required when connecting from an IP address that is not whitelisted in your Salesforce organization's Network Access settings. Most modern Salesforce configurations don't require this token.

=== Creating an OAuth 2.0 Connection

OAuth 2.0 provides more secure authentication and supports automatic token refresh. Follow these steps:

==== Prerequisites

Before creating an OAuth connection in Hop, you need to set up a Connected App in Salesforce:

1. Log in to Salesforce
2. Go to Setup > Apps > App Manager (in newer Salesforce interfaces, this may be under Setup > Platform Tools > Apps > App Manager or Setup > External Client Apps)
3. Click "New Connected App"
4. Fill in the required fields:
   * Connected App Name: e.g., "Apache Hop Integration"
   * API Name: will be auto-populated
   * Contact Email: your email address
5. Enable OAuth Settings:
   * Check "Enable OAuth Settings"
   * Set Callback URL: e.g., `https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` (this can be any valid URL; you'll extract the authorization code from it)
   * Select OAuth Scopes: at minimum, select "Full access (full)" or "Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)"
6. Save the Connected App
7. Copy the Consumer Key (Client ID) and Consumer Secret (Client Secret) - you'll need these in Hop

==== Authorizing and Obtaining Tokens

Once your Connected App is configured, create the OAuth connection in Hop:

1. Open the Metadata Perspective in Hop GUI
2. Navigate to Salesforce Connection in the metadata tree
3. Right-click and select "New Salesforce Connection"
4. Enter a descriptive name for your connection
5. Select "OAuth" as the Authentication Type
6. Fill in the OAuth settings:
   * **Client ID**: Paste the Consumer Key from your Salesforce Connected App
   * **Client Secret**: Paste the Consumer Secret from your Salesforce Connected App
   * **Redirect URI**: Use the same Callback URL you configured in Salesforce (e.g., `https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`)
   * **Instance URL**: Your Salesforce instance URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.my.salesforce.com` or `https://yourcompany.lightning.force.com`)
7. Click the "Authorize" button to start the OAuth flow

==== Authorization Flow

When you click "Authorize", a browser window will open with the Salesforce login page:

1. **Login**: Enter your Salesforce credentials and log in
2. **Force Re-authorization** (Optional): If you're already logged in to Salesforce, you may not see the authorization screen. To force Salesforce to show the authorization screen again, add `&prompt=login` to the authorization URL
3. **Grant Access**: Click "Allow" to authorize the application
4. **Extract Authorization Code**: 
   * After authorization, Salesforce will redirect to your callback URL
   * The browser will show an error (this is expected since the URL doesn't exist)
   * **Copy the full URL from your browser's address bar** - it will look like: `https://localhost:8080/oauth/callback?code=aPrxh7N...`
   * The authorization code is the value after `code=` in the URL
5. **Exchange Code for Tokens**:
   * Return to Hop and paste the authorization code into the "Authorization Code" field (if prompted)
   * Click "Exchange Code" or "Get Tokens" button
   * Hop will automatically exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens
   * The Access Token and Refresh Token fields will be automatically populated

6. Click "Test Connection" to verify the OAuth connection works
7. If successful, click "OK" to save the connection

NOTE: The access token is used for API calls and expires after a period (typically a few hours). The refresh token is used to automatically obtain a new access token when the old one expires, without requiring user interaction.

==== Token Management

* **Access Token**: Automatically refreshed by Hop when it expires
* **Refresh Token**: Stored securely and used for obtaining new access tokens
* **Token Encryption**: Both tokens are encrypted using Hop's password encryption when saved
* **Token Lifetime**: Access tokens typically expire in 1-2 hours, but refresh tokens remain valid until revoked

== Usage

=== Using in Salesforce Transforms

1. Open any Salesforce transform dialog
2. In the Connection section, select your Salesforce Connection from the dropdown
3. The transform will automatically use the connection settings
4. Individual connection fields (URL, username, password) will be disabled when a metadata connection is selected

=== Variable Support

All connection fields support Hop variables:

[source,properties]
----
Username: ${SF_USER}
Password: ${SF_PASS}
Target URL: ${SF_URL}
----

This allows you to use different credentials for different environments without changing your pipelines.

== Best Practices

=== Security

* Use environment variables for sensitive information like passwords and tokens
* Store OAuth tokens securely using Hop's password encryption
* Regularly rotate access tokens and refresh tokens

=== Organization

* Use descriptive names for connections (e.g., "Salesforce-Production", "Salesforce-Sandbox")
* Group related connections by environment or purpose
* Document connection purposes in the connection name or description

=== Performance

* Use OAuth 2.0 for production environments as it provides better security and automatic token refresh
* Test connections regularly to ensure they remain valid
* Use appropriate timeout settings for your network environment

== Examples

=== Basic Username/Password Connection

[source,properties]
----
Name: Salesforce-Production
Authentication Type: Username/Password
Username: ${SF_USER}
Password: ${SF_PASS}
Target URL: https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/64.0
----

=== OAuth Connection

[source,properties]
----
Name: Salesforce-OAuth-Production
Authentication Type: OAuth
Client ID: ${SF_CLIENT_ID}
Client Secret: ${SF_CLIENT_SECRET}
Instance URL: https://yourcompany.my.salesforce.com
----

== Migration from Inline Connections

Existing Salesforce transforms using inline connection settings will continue to work without changes. To migrate to metadata connections:

1. Create a Salesforce Connection metadata item with your current settings
2. Open each Salesforce transform dialog
3. Select the new metadata connection from the dropdown
4. Save the transform

The inline connection fields will be automatically disabled when a metadata connection is selected.

== Troubleshooting

=== Connection Test Failures

* Verify your username and password are correct
* Check if your organization requires a security token
* Ensure your IP address is whitelisted (if IP restrictions are enabled)
* Verify the Target URL is correct for your Salesforce instance

=== OAuth Issues

* Ensure your Connected App is properly configured in Salesforce
* Verify the Redirect URI matches your Connected App settings
* Check that your Connected App has the necessary OAuth scopes
* Ensure access and refresh tokens are valid and not expired

=== Variable Resolution

* Verify variables are properly defined in your environment
* Check variable names are spelled correctly
* Ensure variables are accessible in the current context
