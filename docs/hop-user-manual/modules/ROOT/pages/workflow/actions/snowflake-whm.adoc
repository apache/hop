:description: The Snowflake Warehouse Manager action provides functionality to create, drop, resume, suspend, and alter warehouses.

= Snowflake Warehouse Manager

The Snowflake Warehouse Manager action provides functionality to create, drop, resume, suspend, and alter warehouses.
This allows Hop workflows to resume a warehouse before loading, and then suspend the warehouse as soon as it is done, along with resizing warehouses for portions of the load that may require more processing power.

== Options

- **Warehouse name**: The name of the warehouse
- **Action**: (Create, Drop, Resume, Suspend, Alter) What is the action you wish to take against the warehouse.

=== Action: Create warehouse

This action creates a new warehouse using the settings you provide.

- **Replace?**: If the warehouse already exists, replace the existing warehouse with your new settings.
- **Fail if warehouse exists?**: If the warehouse already exists the action will fail.  If not checked and Replace? is not checked the action will perform no action if the warehouse already exists.
- **Warehouse Size**: (X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, X-Large, 2X-Large, 3X-Large) The size of the warehouse to create.
- **Warehouse Type**: (Standard, Enterprise) The type of warehouse to create.  Enterprise warehouses have more memory available than Standard warehouses.
- **Max cluster size**: The maximum cluster size for clustered warehouses.
- **Min cluster size**: The minimum cluster size for clustered warehouses.
- **Auto suspend**: The number of minutes of inactivity after which the warehouse will automatically suspend.
- **Auto resume?**: Should the warehouse automatically resume when queries are run against it?
