:description: The Join action waits for parallel branches.

== Join Action

=== Description

The *Join* action is used to synchronize parallel branches in a workflow. It acts as a control point that *waits for all preceding parallel branches at the same level* to complete before continuing with the next action(s). 

This eliminates the need to create separate child workflows solely for the purpose of joining and continuing execution after parallel tasks have completed.

=== Usage

Traditionally in Apache Hop, if you wanted to run parts of a workflow in parallel and then continue with a sequential flow, you would isolate those parallel sections in a child workflow. This was necessary to prevent downstream actions from being executed prematurely.

With the new *Join* action, this workaround is no longer needed.

To use the Join action:

. Configure your workflow with multiple outgoing hops from a single action.
. Enable *parallel execution* on the outgoing hops you want to run in parallel.
. Add the *Join* action at the point where all parallel branches converge.
. Connect all parallel branches to the *Join* action with regular (non-parallel) hops.
. Connect the *Join* action to the next action you want to execute *after all parallel tasks have finished*.

=== Example Workflow Structure

When executed:

* The actions `pipeline-1`, `pipeline-2` and `pipeline-3` run in parallel.
* The `join` action waits until `pipeline-1`, `pipeline-2` and `pipeline-3` are finished.
* Once they complete, the workflow continues with final action `check-datasets`.

=== Benefits

* *Simplifies parallel execution:* No need for a separate child workflow just to coordinate branches.
* *Improves readability:* Your parallel and sequential logic can be maintained in a single workflow.
* *Increases maintainability:* Fewer components and external dependencies (child workflows) to manage.
