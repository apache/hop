= Neo4j Cypher Script

== Description

With this action you can execute Cypher statements in a workflow.
The goal is not to retrieve data but to execute various statements like creating or dropping indexes, calling APOC procedures, add or delete some static data and so on.

== Important

**To allow you to enter semi-colons (;) in commands, strings and so on we require you to separate commands with a semi-colon on a new line**

== Configuration options

|Connection name
|The name of the connection on which you want to execute the cypher statements.
