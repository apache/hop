:description: The Move Files action moves a number of files and/or folders to alternate locations on your file system.

= Move Files

== Description

This also works on remote file systems via xref:vfs.adoc[VFS], e.g. with FTP.

Example for a move (rename) of a file on a FTP server (username/password must be given for source and destination).

* File source: \ftp://username:password@ftpserver/dir/testfile_partly.txt
* File destination: \ftp://username:password@ftpserver/dir/testfile.txt
* Check "Destination is a file" in the "Destination File" tab.
