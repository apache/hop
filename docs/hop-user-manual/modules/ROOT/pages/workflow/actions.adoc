== Action Plugins

Actions are used the objects that are executed in a workflow. They are logical operators that do not manipulate your data but create actions that have to be performed around your pipelines.

Actions in a workflow typically do not process your data, nor do they pass on data to the next action. When an action finishes running, it returns a true or false error code that can be used to drive the workflows behavior through true/false or unconditional (ignore exit code) workflows hops.
