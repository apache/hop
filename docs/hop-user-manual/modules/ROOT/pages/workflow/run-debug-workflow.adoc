= Run and Debug a Workflow

== Run your first Workflow

As with designing workflows, the steps to run a workflow are very similar to running a pipeline.

Click the 'run' button image:getting-started/icons/run.svg[Run, 25px, align="bottom"] in your workflow toolbar

In the workflow run dialog, hit the 'New' button in the upper right corner to create a new 'Workflow run configuration'.

In the dialog that pops up, add 'Local Workflow' as the workflow configuration name and choose the 'Local workflow engine'.

Click 'OK' to return to the workflow run dialog. 

Choose the logging level as described below.

This workflow with our very basic pipeline should execute in less than one second. You'll now have the execution results pane which again looks very similar to the pipeline execution results.
