TIP: Starting with Oracle Database 11g Release 1 (11.1), data type `Date` will be mapped to `Timestamp` by default.
Set JDBC property `oracle.jdbc.mapDateToTimestamp=false` to avoid data type `Date` being converted to data type `Timestamp`. +
Check xref:database/databases.adoc#_options[Options] in the Relational Database Connection docs for more information.

== Creating connections

There are 3 ways to create a connection to an Oracle database in Apache Hop:

* If you have a SID, use this (old) format: `jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:PORT:SID`. +
Put the SID with `:` prefix in the database name

* If you have a service name, use this (newer) format: `jdbc:oracle:thin:@//HOSTNAME:PORT/SERVICENAME`. +
Put the service name with `/` prefix in the database name

* If you want to use TNS format: `jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=host) (PORT=port)) (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=service_name))`. +
Put the TNS description in the database name and leave the hostname and port empty.
