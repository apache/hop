:description: Getting Started (5/8): Hop Gui is Hop's visual development environment where you design, run and debug your workflows and pipelines. In this step, we'll take a quick tour of the user interface and describe some of the functionalities in Hop GUI.

= Hop Gui

The Apache Hop GUI is your local development environment to build, run, preview and debug workflows and pipelines.

Let's divide the view into two parts:

* The **main toolbar** offers a range of functions, including creating new files (such as pipelines and workflows) and adding metadata. It also provides options for managing projects and environments, as well as tools specifically for handling pipelines, workflows, and project settings.
* The **perspectives toolbar** includes switcher icons between the various perspectives.

Let's see how we can use Hop Gui to do what Hop is all about: create pipelines and workflows!
