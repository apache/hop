:description: Getting Started (5/8): Hop Gui is Hop's visual development environment where you design, run and debug your workflows and pipelines. In this step, we'll take a quick tour of the user interface and describe some of the functionalities in Hop GUI.

= Hop Gui

The Apache Hop GUI is your local development environment to build, run, preview and debug workflows and pipelines.

== Start the Apache Hop GUI

As we've seen in xref:getting-started/hop-tools.adoc[Hop Tools], starting Hop-Gui is easy:

On Linux or Mac:

[source,bash]
￼./hop-gui.sh

On Windows:

[source,shell script]
hop-gui.bat

== Walking through the Hop GUI

After starting the Apache Hop GUI, you’ll be presented with the window below.

Let's divide the view into three parts:

￼

* the **menu bar** includes options mainly for managing pipelines and workflows and the Apache Hop GUI configuration.
* the **main toolbar** includes the New option to create files (pipelines and workflows) and metadata, and the options to manage projects and environments.
* the **perspectives toolbar** includes switcher icons between the various perspectives.

Let's see how we can use Hop Gui to do what Hop is all about: create pipelines and workflows!

INFO: check the xref:../hop-gui/index.adoc[Hop Gui] section of the Hop documentation for a more detailed tour of the Hop Gui.
