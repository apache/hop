= Download and Install Hop

Hop is designed to be as easy and accessible to use as possible.

Getting and starting Hop couldn't be easier:

== Download

Download Hop from the http://hop.apache.org/download/[downloads page].

== Prerequisites

Hop is self contained, all you need is a Java runtime. Hop has been developed and tested with Java 8, but you shouldn't have any issues running Hop with Java 11. Check the https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html[Java docs] to download and install a Java runtime for your operating system.

== Install

Unzip Hop to a folder of your choice. From that folder, you'll be able to run the different Hop xref:hop-tools/index.adoc[tools] through their corresponding scripts.

Now that you have Hop installed, let's have a look at all of the Hop tools you have at your disposal.
