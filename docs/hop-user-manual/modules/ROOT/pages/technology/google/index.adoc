= Google Technology

== Introduction

The Google technology stack is supported in Hop through a number of plugins.  We briefly touch upon them below.

== Pipeline Transforms

* xref:pipeline/transforms/googleanalytics.adoc[Google Analytics]: You can use the `Google Analytics` transform to get information from this service.
* xref:pipeline/transforms/googlesheetsinput.adoc[Google Sheets Input] and xref:pipeline/transforms/googlesheetsoutput.adoc[Google Sheets Output]: It can be very convenient to save data into a Google sheet or indeed to read from it.  You can do this using the `Google Sheets Input` and `Google Sheets Output` transforms.

== VFS

Apache xref:vfs.adoc[VFS Support] in Hop allows you to directly read from a multitude of file systems and protocols, including Google:

* xref:vfs/google-drive-vfs.adoc[Google Drive]: read and write data directly from and to Google Drive files and folders.
* xref:vfs/google-cloud-storage-vfs.adoc[Google Cloud Storage]: read and write data directly from and to files and folders in Google Cloud Storage buckets
