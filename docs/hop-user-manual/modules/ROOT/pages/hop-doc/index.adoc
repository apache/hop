:description: Hop doc is a command that you can use to document your projects

= hop doc

The `hop doc` can be used to document a project in https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/[MarkDown] format.
It will create a separate file per workflow and pipeline, add an index, and so on.
You can then serve up this documentation by MarkDown tools like https://www.mkdocs.org/[mkdocs]

== Options

You can run the `hop help doc` command to see the options:

On Windows, run `hop.bat help doc`.
The command on Mac and Linux is `sh hop help doc`.

You'll see the option listed in a similar output to the one below:

As you can see, the `projects` plugin contributes options to select a project or environment, making it not needed to remember which folder the project was stored in.
