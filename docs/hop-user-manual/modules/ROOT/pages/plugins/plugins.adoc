= Plugins

Hop is built around an eco-system of plugins, this gives the end users and infrastructure team the ability to create a custom version of HOP tailored to the project or company needs.

The plugins are located in the following location `Instalation Directory/plugins`

The current plugin structure looks like this (with the amount of changes happening in Hop, new plugins may have appeared in your latest nightly build).

This plugin organization is mainly technical, there is no 1 on 1 mapping between the plugins you'll find in the plugins directory and what you'll see in Hop Gui. For Example, the neo4j plugins category contains plugins for actions, transforms, metadata types, the Neo4j perspective etc.
