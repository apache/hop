                    <searchString>
      <searchString>         The string to search for
  -e, --environment=<environmentOption>
                             The name of the lifecycle environment to use
  -h, --help                 Displays this help message and quits.
  -i, --case-insensitive     Perform a case insensitive search
  -j, --project=<projectOption>
                             The name of the project to use

== Examples

Example command: search for the string 'json' (case insensitive) in the 'hop-samples' project.

Command: `./hop-search.sh -j hop-samples -i json `

Output:

<PROJECT_PATH>/samples/transforms/Enhanced JSON - Generate complex nested structure from table.hpl : null : matching property value: This sample gets a table of values and generate a complex nested structure as output
by looping over a predefined key. Second Enhanced JSON Transform als gets a JSON fragment produced
by furst Enhanced JSON Transform and use it as value of an attribute of the resulting final 
JSON stream.
