:description: This describes how to use the versatile hop command line tool.

= Hop

The `hop` command line tool is simplification of the many scripts that the project ships with like 'hop-run`, `hop-search`, `hop-gui`, and so on.
The main goal is to have a single wrapper script to make maintenance easier for the developers, but also to allow plugins to contribute new commands.
