=== Configuration on the command line

The ```hop-conf``` script offers many options to edit environment definitions.


==== Creating an environment

[source,bash]
----
$ sh hop-conf.sh \
     --environment-create \
     --environment hop2 \
     --environment-project hop2 \
     --environment-purpose=Development \
     --environment-config-files=/home/user/projects/hop2-conf.json
Creating environment 'hop2'
Environment 'hop2' was created in Hop configuration file <path-to-hop>/config/hop-config.json
2021/02/01 16:37:02 - General - ERROR: Configuration file '/home/user/projects/hop2-conf.json' does not exist to read variables from.

  hop2
    Purpose: Development
    Configuration files:
    Project name: hop2
      Config file: /home/user/projects/hop2-conf.json

----

As you can see from the log, an empty file was created to set variables in:

[source,json]
----
{ }
----

==== Setting variables in an environment

This command adds a variable to the environment configuration file:

[source,bash]
----
$ h hop-conf.sh --config-file /home/user/projects/hop2-conf.json --config-file-set-variables DB_HOSTNAME=localhost,DB_PASSWORD=abcd
Configuration file '/home/user/projects/hop2-conf.json' was modified.
----

If we look at the file ```hop2-conf.json``` we'll see that the variables were added:

[source,json]
----
{
  "variables" : [ {
    "name" : "DB_HOSTNAME",
    "value" : "localhost",
    "description" : ""
  }, {
    "name" : "DB_PASSWORD",
    "value" : "abcd",
    "description" : ""
  } ]
}
----

Please note that you can add descriptions for the variables as well with the ```--describe-variable``` option.
Please run hop-conf without options to see all the possibilities.

==== Deleting an environment

The following deletes an environment from the Hop configuration file:

[source,bash]
----
$ $ sh hop-conf.sh --environment-delete --environment hop2
Lifecycle environment 'hop2' was deleted from Hop configuration file <path-to-hop>/config/hop-config.json
----

=== Projects Plugin configuration

There are various options to configure the behavior of the ```Projects``` plugin itself.
In Hop configuration file ```hop-config.json``` we can find the following options:

[source,json]
----
{
    "projectMandatory" : true,
    "environmentMandatory" : false,
    "defaultProject" : "default",
    "defaultEnvironment" : null,
