:description: Follow the instruction on this page to set up a minimal installation to run the Apache Hop samples for the Apache Beam run configurations for Apache Flink.

:toc:

= Running the Apache Beam samples With Apache Flink

== Get Flink

Check the xref:pipeline/beam/getting-started-with-beam.adoc#supportedversions[Supported Versions] on the Getting Started With Beam page to find the latest supported Flink version for your Hop version.

For example, for Hop 1.2, the latest currently supported version is 1.13. Make sure to download Flink for a recent and JDK 8 compatible Scale version. For Flink 1.3.6, this is Scala 2.11.

Download your selected Flink version and unzip to a convenient location.

== Start your local Flink single node cluster

To keep things as simple as possible, we'll run a local single node Flink cluster with a single command.

In the folder where you unzipped Flink to, run:

`bin/start-cluster.sh`

Your output should look similar to the one below:

[source,shell]
----
Starting cluster.
Starting standalonesession daemon on host <HOSTNAME>.
Starting taskexecutor daemon on host <HOSTNAME>.
----

The cluster shouldn't take more than a couple of seconds to start. Once Flink is available, you'll be able to access your Flink Dashboard at http://localhost:8081/

== Flink Run Configuration setup

In Hop Gui's metadata perspective for the Samples project, edit the `Flink` pipeline run configuration and make sure the `Fat jar file location` (the very last option) points to the Hop fat jar you created earlier in the xref:pipeline/beam/running-the-beam-samples.adoc#_prerequisites[prerequisites].

== From Hop GUI

TIP: Running Hop pipelines on embedded Flink through Hop Gui will work just fine but is intended for testing purposes and won't show in your Flink dashboard. You can leave the default Flink master to `[local]` to run the embedded Flink engine from Hop Gui.

Set your Flink master to your cluster's master. For embedded Flink, `[local]` will do.

Go back to the data orchestration perspective and run one of the Beam pipelines in the samples project. In this example, we used `samples/beam/pipelines/generate-synthetic-data.hpl`

When you start your pipeline from Hop Gui, it will appear in your Flink Dashboard.

== From Flink Run

In a real-world setup, you'll run your Flink pipelines from the Flink master through `flink run`.

Set your Flink master to `[auto]` and export your Hop metadata again (see xref:pipeline/beam/running-the-beam-samples.adoc#_prerequisites[prerequisites]).

image:beam/beam-flink-run-config-host.png[Apache Beam - Flink run configuration - master, width="40%"]

Unlike Spark you can not pass java options at runtime to the TaskManager. So we also want to set the `PROJECT_HOME` variable in the run configuration. This variable is used during execution to know where the source files are. (Metadata perspective -> Pipeline Run Configuration -> Flink -> Variables)
Alternatively, you can provide a 4th argument after the run configuration name: the name of the environment configuration file to use.

image:beam/beam-flink-run-config-variables.png[Apache Beam - Flink run configuration - master, width="40%"]

Use a command like the one below to pass all the information required by `flink run`.

[source, shell]
----
bin/flink run \
  --class org.apache.hop.beam.run.MainBeam \
  --parallelism 2 \
  /opt/flink/hop-fat-jar.jar \
  <PATH>/hop/config/projects/samples/beam/pipelines/generate-synthetic-data.hpl \
  /opt/flink/hop-metadata.json \
  Flink
----

With your Hop and Flink set up correctly, your output will look similar to what's shown below:

[source, shell]
----
Argument 1 : Pipeline filename (.hpl)   : <YOUR_PATH>/hop/config/projects/samples/beam/pipelines/generate-synthetic-data.hpl
Argument 2 : Metadata filename (.json)  : /opt/flink/hop-metadata.json
Argument 3 : Pipeline run configuration : Flink

2022/02/11 12:52:45 - General - Beam pipeline execution has finished.
>>>>>> Execution finished...
----

After your pipeline finishes and the flink run command ends, your Flink dashboard will show a new entry in the 'Completed Job List'. You can follow up any running applications in the 'Running Job List' and drill down into their execution details while running.
