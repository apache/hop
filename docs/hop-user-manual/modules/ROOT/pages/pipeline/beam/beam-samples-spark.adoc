:description: Follow the instruction on this page to set up a minimal installation to run the Apache Hop samples for the Apache Beam run configurations for Apache Spark.

:toc:

= Running the Apache Beam samples With Apache Spark

== Get Spark

Check the xref:pipeline/beam/getting-started-with-beam.adoc#supportedversions[Supported Versions] on the Getting Started With Beam page to find the latest supported Spark version for your Hop version.

For example, for Hop 1.2, the latest currently supported version is 3.1.2.

Download your selected Spark version and unzip to a convenient location.

== Start your local Spark single node cluster

To keep things as simple as possible, we'll run a local single node Spark cluster.

First we need to start our local master. This can be done with a single command from the folder where you unzipped Spark:

run `<SPARK_FOLDER>/sbin/start-master.sh`.

Your output should look similar to the one below:

[source, shell]
----
starting org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master, logging to <PATH>/spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2/logs/spark-<USER>-org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-<HOSTNAME>.out
----

You should now be able to access the Spark Master's web ui at http://localhost:8080.

Copy the master's url from the master's page header, e.g. `spark://localhost.localdomain:7077`.

With the master in place, we can start a worker (formerly called slave). Similar to the master, this is a single command that takes the master's url that yo

`sbin/start-worker.sh spark://localhost.localdomain:7077`.

Your output should look similar to the one below:

[source, shell]
----
starting org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker, logging to <PATH>/spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2/logs/spark-<USER>-org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker-1-<HOSTNAME>.out
----

== Run sample pipeline with Spark Submit

Since Spark doesn't support remote execution, we'll be running one of the sample pipelines through Spark Submit.

Use a command like the one below to pass all the information required by `spark-submit`.

[source, shell]
----
bin/spark-submit \
  --master spark://localhost.localdomain:7077 \
  --class org.apache.hop.beam.run.MainBeam \
  --driver-java-options '-DPROJECT_HOME=<PATH>/hop/config/projects/samples' \
  /opt/spark/hop-fat-jar.jar \
  <PATH>/hop/config/projects/samples/beam/pipelines/input-process-output.hpl \
  /opt/spark/hop-metadata.json \
  Spark
----

In this case, the fat jar and metadata export files were saved to `/opt/spark`. The last argument, `Spark`, is the name of the Spark pipeline run configuration in the samples project. Replace with the necessary arguments for your environment and run.

You should see verbose logging output similar to the output below:

[source, shell]

After your pipeline finishes and the spark-submit command ends, your Spark master ui will show a new entry in the 'Finished Applications' list. You can follow up any running applications in the 'Running Applications' and drill down into their execution details while running.
