= Create a Pipeline

TODO: this content is based on the https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/getting-started.html[Getting Started Guide]. Elaborate more.

Pipelines are the fundamentals of your project. A pipeline contains operations executed in a predefined order. Pipelines consist of a chain of transforms that read, process or write data. The image below shows a simple pipeline that reads data from a table, adds a message to the data and sends out an email.

== Concepts

Pipelines consist of transforms connected by hops. In the mail example 'Table input', 'Add message' and 'Mail' are all transforms.

* **transforms** are the basic operations in your pipeline. A pipeline typically consists of a lot of transforms that are chained together by hops.
Transforms are granular, in the sense that each transform is designed and optimized to perform one and only one task. Although one transform by itself may not offer spectacular functionality, the combination of all transforms in a pipeline is makes your pipelines powerful.

* **hops** link transforms together. When a transform finishes processing the data set it received, that data set is passed to the next transform through a hop.
Hops are uni-directional (data can't flow backwards). Hops only buffer and pass data around, the hop itself is transform-agnostic, it doesn't know anything about the transforms it passes data from or to.
Some transforms can read from or write to other transforms conditionally to or from a number of other transforms, but this a transform-specific configuration. The hop is unaware of it.
Hops can be disabled by clicking on them, or through right-click -> disable.

== Creation

Create a new pipeline through the https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/hop-gui/workitems.html[New Work Item] dialog. You'll be presented with the dialog shown below.

image::hop-gui/pipeline/new-pipeline.png[Hop - New Pipeline, 75%, align="left"]

When you are finished with your pipeline, save it. This can be done via the File menu, the icons or using CTLR s or Command s. For new pipelines a file browser is displayed to navigate towards the location you want to store the file.

== Add Transform to your pipelines

Click anywhere in the pipeline canvas, the area where you'll see the image below.

image::getting-started/getting-started-click-anywhere.png[Hop - Click Anywhere, 45% , align="left"]

Upon clicking, you'll be presented with the dialog shown below. The search box at the top of this dialog works for transform, name, tags (TODO) etc.
Once you've found the transform you're looking for, click on it to add it to your pipeline. An alternative to clicking is arrow key navigation + enter.
Repeat this step now or whenever you want to add more transforms to your pipeline.
Once you've added a transform to your pipeline, you can drag to reposition it.

Check the https://hop.apache.org/manual/latest/plugins/transforms.html[list] of transforms to add to your pipeline for more details.

Add a 'Generate Rows' and a 'Add Sequence' transform, and your pipeline should like the one below.

image::getting-started/getting-started-add-two-transforms.png[Hop - Add two transforms, 75% , align="left"]

The transform object can be configured through a single click on the object. The menu displayed below will be shown based on your transform object.

== Add a Hop between transforms

There are a number of ways to create a hop:

* shift-drag: while holding down the shift key on your keyboard. Click on a transform, while holding down your primary mouse button, drag to the second transform. Release the primary mouse button and the shift key.
* scroll-drag: scroll-click on a transform , while holding down your mouse's scroll button, drag to the second transform. Release the scroll button.
* click on a transform in your pipeline to open the 'click anywhere' dialog. Click the 'Create hop' image::getting-started/icons/HOP.svg[Create hop, 25px, align="bottom"] button and select the transform you want to create the hop to.

image::getting-started/getting-started-create-hop.png[Hop - Create Hop, 65% , align="left"]

Some transforms result in different types of hops.

[width="85%", cols="30%, 70%", options="header"]
|===
|Hop|Description
|Result is TRUE|Specifies that the transform will be executed only when the result from the previous transform is true
|Result is FALSE|pecifies that the transform will be executed only when the result from the previous transform is false
|Main output of transform|The default hop between two transforms

== Pipeline properties
Pipeline properties are a collection of properties that describe the pipeline and configure its behavior.

The properties dialog can be opened by double clicking on the pipeline canvas.

Following properties can be configured:

* Pipeline
* Parameters
* Monitoring

image::hop-gui/pipeline/properties-pipeline.png[Pipeline properties, 75% , align="left"]

The Pipeline tab allows you to specify general properties about the pipeline including:

[width="85%", cols="30%, 70%", options="header"]
|===
|Property|Description
|Pipeline name| The name of the pipeline
|Synchronize name with filename|If option is enabled the filename and pipeline name are synchronized.
|Pipeline filename| The filename of the pipeline
|Description|Short description of the pipeline
|Extended description| Long extended description of the pipeline
|Status| Draft or production status
|Version|Description of the version
|Created by| Displays the original creator of the pipeline
|Created at|Displays the date and time when the pipeline was created.
|Last modified by| Displays the last user that modified the pipeline
|Last modified at|Displays the date and time when the pipeline was last modified.
|===

The parameters tab allows you to specify parameters specific for the pipeline. Parameters are defined by a name, a default value and a description.
