= Parquet File Output

== Description

This transform is capable of writing data into the Apache Parquet file format.
For more information on this see: http://parquet.apache.org/[Apache Parquet].

== Options

Notes:

* The date optionally referenced in the output file name(s) will be the start of the pipeline execution.
* Hop Date types are serialized as EPOC: milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00.000`
* Strings are written as binary in UTF-8
* Compression of data into columnar format is being done in memory.
This happens when all rows are written.
To not run out of memory make sure to specify a split size.

|Option|Description

|Transform name
|Name of the transform this name has to be unique in a single pipeline.

|Base file name
|Specify the base filename.
This is composed of where you want to write the Parquet file to as well as the start of the filename.

Specify a split size larger than 0 and this is then the number of rows per file.
The file part (split) number will be included in the filename to make sure that the same file is not being overwritten.
The split number is formatted with mask `0000`
