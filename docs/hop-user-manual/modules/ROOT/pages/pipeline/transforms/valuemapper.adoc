= Value Mapper

== Description

The Value Mapper transform maps string values from one value to another. Mapping is usually solved by storing the conversion table in a database. The Value Mapper provides you with a simple alternative.

For example, if you want to replace language codes:

[source,bash]
----
Fieldname to use: LanguageCode
Target fieldname: LanguageDesc
Source/Target: EN/English, FR/French, NL/Dutch, ES/Spanish, DE/German, ...
----

== Options

The following properties are used to define the mappings:

[width="90%", options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Transform Name|Name of the transform this name has to be unique in a single pipeline.
|Fieldname to use|Field to use as the mapping source
|Target field name|Field to use as the mapping Target
|Default upon non-matching|Defines a default value for situations where the source value is not empty, but there is no match
|Field values table|Contains the mapping of source value to converted target value 
|===

== Metadata Injection Support

All fields of this transform support metadata injection. You can use this transform with ETL Metadata Injection to pass metadata to your pipeline at runtime.
