== Description

The Snowflake ID Generator transform generates globally unique identifiers (IDs) based on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID[Snowflake algorithm]. Each generated ID is a 64-bit long integer that encodes a timestamp, data center ID, machine ID, and sequence number, ensuring uniqueness across distributed systems.

Use this transform to generate unique IDs for your data rows in distributed ETL pipelines.
The generated IDs are time-ordered and can be used as primary keys, message identifiers, or other globally unique keys in data processing systems.

Typical use cases:

- Generating unique keys for records before inserting into a database.
- Ensuring globally unique event IDs in streaming data pipelines.
- Replacing database auto-increment IDs in distributed environments.
