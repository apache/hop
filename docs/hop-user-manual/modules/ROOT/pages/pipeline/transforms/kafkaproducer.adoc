=== Avro and Schema registry

Here are some options you need to send Avro Record values to a Kafka server.
The schema of Avro values are not sent to Kafka but to a schema registry.  As such you need to have one available.
Here are some options you need to set to make this work on a Confluent Cloud Kafka instance.  There are various parts of the software stack that need authentication, hence the bit of redundancy.   We recommend that you put these options in variables in your environment configuration file.
