|===

Schema mapping is a useful mapping transform to precede transforms like xref:pipeline/transforms/textfileoutput.adoc[Text File Output] or xref:pipeline/transforms/excelwriter.adoc[Excel Writer] when we decide to refer to a xref:metadata-types/static-schema-definition.adoc[Schema Definition] to map the output layout of the file. By preceding these transforms with the Schema Mapping, the incoming stream will be already setup according to the expected output layout definition.

== Options

[options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Schema Definition|Name of the xref:metadata-types/static-schema-definition.adoc[Schema Definition] that we are going to map to the incoming stream.
|Schema Fields|The set of schema fields that are mapped to stream fields.
|Stream Fields name|The set of stream fields that are mapped to schema fields.
|===

* Use _Get fields_ button to fill in the available fields from the incoming stream.
* Use the _Mapping_ button to show a Mapping Dialog that will support the mapping process between the stream's fields and the schema fields.
