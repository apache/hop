== Description

The Calculator transform provides you with predefined functions that can be executed on input field values.

*_Note:_* The execution speed of the Calculator is far better than the speed provided by custom scripts (JavaScript).

In addition to the arguments (Field A, Field B and Field C) you must also specify the return type of the function.
You can also choose to remove the field from the result (output) after all values are calculated; this is useful in cases where you use temporary values that don't need to end up in your pipeline fields.

|Set field to constant A|CONSTANT|
|Create a copy of field A|COPY_OF_FIELD|
|A + B|ADD|A plus B.
|A - B|SUBTRACT|A minus B.
|A * B|MULTIPLY|A multiplied by B.
|A / B|DIVIDE|A divided by B.
|A * A|SQUARE|The square of A.
|SQRT( A )|SQUARE_ROOT|The square root of A.
|100 * A / B|PERCENT_1|Percentage of A in B.
|A - ( A * B / 100 )|PERCENT_2|Subtract B% of A.
|A + ( A * B / 100 )|PERCENT_3|Add B% to A.

|SQRT( A*A + B*B )|COMBINATION_2|Calculate ?(A2+B2).
|ROUND( A )|ROUND_1|Returns the closest Integer to the argument.
The result is rounded to an Integer by adding 1/2, taking the floor of the result, and casting the result to type int.
In other words, the result is equal to the value of the expression: floor (a + 0.5).
In case you need the rounding method "Round half to even", use the following method ROUND( A, B ) with no decimals (B=0).
|ROUND( A, B )|ROUND_2|Round A to the nearest even number with B decimals.
The used rounding method is "Round half to even", it is also called unbiased rounding, convergent rounding, statistician's rounding, Dutch rounding, Gaussian rounding, odd-even rounding, bankers' rounding or broken rounding, and is widely used in bookkeeping.
This is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 computing functions and operators.
In Germany it is often called "Mathematisches Runden".
|STDROUND( A )|ROUND_STD_1|Round A to the nearest integer.
The used rounding method is "Round half away from zero", it is also called standard or common rounding.
In Germany it is known as "kaufmännische Rundung" (and defined in DIN 1333).
|STDROUND( A, B )|ROUND_STD_2|Same rounding method used as in STDROUND (A) but with B decimals.
|CEIL( A )|CEIL|The ceiling function map a number to the smallest following integer.
|FLOOR( A )|FLOOR|The floor function map a number to the largest previous integer.
|NVL( A, B )|NVL|If A is not NULL, return A, else B. Note that sometimes your variable won't be null but an empty string.
|Date A + B days|ADD_DAYS|Add B days to Date field A.
Note: Only integer values for B are supported.
If you need non-integer calculations, please add a second calculation with hours.

|Levenshtein Distance (Source A and Target B)|LEVENSHTEIN_DISTANCE|Calculates the Levenshtein Distance: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
|Metaphone of A (Phonetics)|METAPHONE|Calculates the metaphone of A:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone
|Double metaphone of A|DOUBLE_METAPHONE|Calculates the double metaphone of A: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Metaphone
|Absolute value ABS(A)|ABS|Calculates the Absolute value of A.
|Remove time from a date A|REMOVE_TIME_FROM_DATE|Removes time value of A. Note: Daylight Savings Time (DST) changes in Sao Paulo and some other parts of Brazil at midnight 0:00. This makes it impossible to set the time to 0:00 at the specific date, when the DST changes from 0:00 to 1:00 am.
So, there is one date in one year in these regions where this function will fail with an "IllegalArgumentException: HOUR_OF_DAY: 0 -> 1".
It is not an issue for Europe, the US and other regions where the time changes at 1:00 or 2:00 or 3:00 am.

== Metadata Injection support

All fields of this transform support metadata injection. You can use this transform with ETL Metadata Injection to pass metadata to your pipeline at runtime.

Use the values in the column "Function (Metadata Injection view)" from the table above to specify the operation (Calculation type) applied to the fields.

== FAQ on length and precision and data types affecting the results

*Q*: I made a pipeline using A/B in a calculator transform and it rounded wrong: the 2 input fields are integer but my result type was Number(6, 4) so I would expect the integers to be cast to Number before executing the division.

If I wanted to execute e.g. 28/222, I got 0.0 instead of 0.1261 which I expected.
So it seems the result type is ignored.
If I change the input types both to Number(6, 4) I get as result 0.12612612612612611 which still ignores the result type (4 places after the comma).

Why is this?

*A*: Length & Precision are just metadata pieces.

If you want to round to the specified precision, you should do this in another transform.
However: please keep in mind that rounding double point precision values is futile anyway.
A floating point number is stored as an approximation (it floats) so 0.1261 (your desired output) could (would probably) end up being stored as 0.126099999999 or 0.1261000000001 (Note: this is not the case for BigNumbers)

So in the end we round using BigDecimals once we store the numbers in the output table, but NOT during the pipeline.
The same is true for the Text File Output transform.
If you would have specified Integer as result type, the internal number format would have been retained, you would press "Get Fields" and it the required Integer type would be filled in.
The required conversion would take place there and then.

In short: we convert to the required metadata type when we land the data somewhere, NOT BEFORE.

*Q*: How do the data types work internally? +
*A*: You might notice that if you multiply an Integer and Number, the result is always rounded.
That is because Calculator takes data type of the left hand size of the multiplication (A) as the driver for the calculation.
As such, if you want more precision, you should put field B on the left hand side or change the data type to Number and all will be well.
