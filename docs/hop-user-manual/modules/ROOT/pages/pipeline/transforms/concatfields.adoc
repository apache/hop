== Options

=== General

[options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform.
|Target Field Name|The name of the target field (String type)
|Length of Target Field|The length of the string type (setting the meta-data of the String type, this is also used by the Fast Data Dump option for performance optimization)
|Separator|Specify the character that separates the fields in a single line of text.
Typically this is ; or a tab.
|Enclosure|A pair of strings can enclose some fields.
This allows separator characters in fields.
The enclosure string is optional.
|Force enclosure?|Force adding the enclosing character before and after each field that is added to the concatenated string.
|Remove concatenated fields from output?|If checked, the fields that were used to create the concatenated field (specified in `Target Field Name`) will be removed from the output and wil not be available in later transforms.

=== Fields Tab

This is identical to the fields tab option of the Text File Output transform and has the same functionality.

[options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Name|The name of the field.
|Type|Type of the field can be either String, Date or Number.
|Format|The format mask to convert with.
See Number Formats for a complete description of format symbols.
|Length a|The length option depends on the field type follows:

- Number - Total number of significant figures in a number

- String - total length of string

- Date - length of printed output of the string (e.g. 4 only gives back year)

|Precision a|The precision option depends on the field type as follows:

- Number - Number of floating point digits
- String - unused
- Date - unused

|Currency|Symbol used to represent currencies like $10,000.00 or E5.000,00
|Decimal|A decimal point can be a "." (10,000.00) or "," (5.000,00)
|Group|A grouping can be a "," (10,000.00) or "." (5.000,00)
|Trim type|The trimming method to apply on the string.
Trimming only works when there is no field length given.
|Null|A string to replace null values of this field with, by default null is replaced with an empty string.
|Get|Click to retrieve the list of fields from the input fields stream(s)
|Minimal width|Alter the options in the fields tab in such a way that the resulting width of lines in the text file is minimal.
So instead of save 0000001, we write 1, etc.
String fields will no longer be padded to their specified length.
