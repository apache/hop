= Parquet File Input

== Description

This transform can read (primitive) values from an Apache Parquet file.
For more information on this see: http://parquet.apache.org/[Apache Parquet].

== Options

Notes:

* To support reading from any location through Apache VFS each file is loaded into memory (one at a time).
Make sure to allocate enough memory to allow this.
* Long values can be de-serialized to Dates if they are EPOC: milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00.000`
* Parquet Binary fields are considered to be Hop Strings but you can read them as Hop Binary.
* All input values are passed to the output
* INT96 is converted to the Hop Binary data type.
