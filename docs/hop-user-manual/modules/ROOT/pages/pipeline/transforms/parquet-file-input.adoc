== Options

Notes:

* To support reading from any location through Apache VFS each file is loaded into memory (one at a time).
Make sure to allocate enough memory to allow this.
* Long values can be de-serialized to Dates if they are EPOC: milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00.000`
* Parquet Binary fields are considered to be Hop Strings but you can read them as Hop Binary.
* All input values are passed to the output
* INT96 is converted to the Hop Binary data type.

|Option|Description

|Transform name
|Name of the transform this name has to be unique in a single pipeline.

|Filename field
|Specify the input field.
Use a transform like Get File Names to obtain file names.
Any supported file location is fine.

|Metadata filename
|If you specify a filename here, you can leave the fields section empty and Hop will automatically determine
the output fields.  It prevents you from having to define all the fields when this metadata is already in
a parquet file schema.

|Fields
|In this table you can specify all the fields you want to obtain from the parquet files as well as their desired Hop output type.

|Get fields button
|With this button you can select a parquet file from which we'll read the schema to populate the Fields grid.
