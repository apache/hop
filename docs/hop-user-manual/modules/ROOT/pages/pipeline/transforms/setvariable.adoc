== Description

The Set Variables transform allows you to set variables in a workflow or in the virtual machine.

Variables have no type in Hop (often casted as strings). If working with formulas for example, it may not have a type so be sure to convert to string if necessary (can use the TEXT function).

Set Variables allows you to set variables in a workflow or in the JAVA virtual machine etc. This transform accepts one (and only one) row of data to set the value of a variable. You can use Set Variables on a generated data row or a data row from a table input for example. If you want to set a variable from a pipeline that processes multiple lines of data, make sure you isolate a single row before setting a variable.

Variables set with Set Variable are not available to use in the current pipeline because of threading. If set values are needed in the current pipeline use a data row and use Set Field Value instead.

Setting the variable names to the same variable names from the previous pipeline, is sometimes required as Javascript can use the variable name more easily. For the Variable name use a field name, not the variable syntax like ${myVariable}.

Note that variables cannot be passed upstream between pipelines. Parameters are best passed downstream to avoid threading issues. A nested pipeline is technically the same pipeline, so variables are inherited in the initialization phase.

Though you cannot pass parameters and variables upstream (in nested or sequential pipelines) you can pass data rows back up a pipeline via the following pattern. See project: samples/loops/pipeline-executor.hpl
A variable can be set in one pipeline and be available in the next pipeline (named pipeline) that is in the loop of a pipeline executor.  If you are using a pipeline executor child, the parent pipeline does not restart and does not get any set variables. The new variable name to set in a child pipeline is shown below in the second column.


TIP: This transform accepts one (and only one) row of data to set the value of a variable. If you want to set a variable from a pipeline that processes multiple lines of data, make sure you isolate a single row before setting a variable.

WARNING: You can't set and use a variable in the same pipeline. Since all transforms in a pipeline run in parallel, there is no way a transform in a pipeline can use a variable that is set in another transform in that same pipeline.

|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform.
|Apply formatting|When this option is set, it formats the value (date, numbers etc.) according to the format options.
Otherwise no formatting is done.
|Field Name|Name of the field that is used
|Variable Name|Name of the variable to set (without ${...} or %%...%% sigils)
|Variable scope type a|Define the scope of the variable, possible options are:

* Valid in the virtual machine: the complete virtual machine will know about this variable.
* Valid in the parent workflow: the variable is only valid in the parent workflow.
* Valid in the grand-parent workflow: the variable is valid in the grand-parent workflow and all the child workflows and pipelines.
* Valid in the root workflow: the variable is valid in the root workflow and all the child workflows and pipelines.

|Default value|Value that will be set for empty rows
