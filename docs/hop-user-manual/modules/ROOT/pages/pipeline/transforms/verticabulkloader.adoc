= Vertica Bulk Loader

The Vertica Bulk Loader uses https://www.vertica.com/docs/12.0.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/ConnectingToVertica/ClientJDBC/UsingVerticaCopyStream.htm[VerticaCopyStream] to stream to a Vertica database.

This is typically significantly faster than loading data through e.g. a Table Output transform.
