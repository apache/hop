For additional information about MongoDB, see the MongoDB http://www.mongodb.org/[documentation].

=== Delete query

* use JSON query:
** when disabled (default), the transform deletes documents based on key/value pair comparisons. The table requires the following fields:
*** Mongo document path: the document path to delete
*** Comparator: `=`,`<>`,``,``,`<`,`<=`,`>`,`>=`,`BETWEEN`,`IS NULL`,`IS NOT NULL`
*** Incoming field 1: a first comparison stream field
*** Incoming fields 2: a second comparison stream field (for use with `BETWEEN`)
** when enabled:
*** a delete query is passed to MongoDB for deletion.
*** execute for each row: pass the delete query to the database for each incoming row

=== Delete query examples:

Delete based on document paths and stream fields (`use JSON query` disabled):
|===
|Mongo document path|Comparator|Incoming field 1|Incoming field 2
|name|=|lastname|
|firstname|=|firstname|
|===

Delete based on JSON query (`use JSON query` enabled):
`{$or: [{"name": "${NAME1}"},{"name": "${NAME2}"}, {"name": "${NAME3}"} ]}`
