|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform. Note: This name has to be unique in a single pipeline.
|Type a|The type of checksum that needs to be calculated.  These are the types that are available:

* CRC32 : 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check
*ADLER 32 : Checksum algorithm by Mark Adler: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adler-32
* MD5 : Message Digest algorithm 5 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5
* SHA-1 : Secure Hash Algorithm 1 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1
* SHA-256 : Secure Hash Algorithm 2 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-256
|Result Type|Some checksum types allow to set different result types: String, Hexadecimal and Binary
|Result field|The name of the result field containing the checksum
|Fields used in the checksum|The names of the fields to include in the checksum calculation.
