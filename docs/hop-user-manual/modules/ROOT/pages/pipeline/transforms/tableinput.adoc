Below is a SQL statement:

This SQL statement requests two calendar dates, to create a range, that are read from the Insert data from transform option. The target date range can be provided using the Get System Info transform. For example, if you want to read all customers that have had their data changed yesterday, you can get a target range for yesterday and read the customer data.
