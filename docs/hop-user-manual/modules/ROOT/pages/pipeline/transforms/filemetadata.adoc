= File Metadata

== Description

This transform scans a file to determine its metadata structure or layout.
Use this transforms in situations where you need to read a structured text file (e.g. CSV, TSV) when you don't know the exact layout in advance.
The information provided in this file can be used to actually read the file later, e.g. through metadata injection.
The layout detected depends on the number of rows scanned.
For example, if the first 100 rows of a file are scanned and the first field is detected as an integer, there is a possibility this field contains alphanumerical characters in later rows.
Using 0 rows for 'limit scanned rows' is a way to make sure the entire file is scanned and the layout is detected correctly, even though this may be time consuming or even impossible for large files.

== Options

[width="90%",options="header"]
