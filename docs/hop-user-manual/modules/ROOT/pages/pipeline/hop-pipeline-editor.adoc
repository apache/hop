= Toolbar

You learned to create a pipeline in xref:pipeline/create-pipeline.adoc[Create a Pipeline]. You'll perform a lot of operations on the pipeline canvas, but a lot of additional functionality is available from the pipeline editor's main toolbar.

There are two other important toolbars to work with xref:pipeline/pipeline-unit-testing.adoc[unit tests] and xref:projects/index.adoc[projects and environments]. Check the respective pages to learn more about managing your projects and environments and to learn how to write unit tests for your pipelines.

Let's walk through the top toolbar:
