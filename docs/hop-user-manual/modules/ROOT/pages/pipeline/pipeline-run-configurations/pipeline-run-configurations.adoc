= Pipeline Run Configurations

== Description

Run configurations decouple the design and execution phases of Hop pipeline development.
A pipeline is a definition of _how_ data is processed, a run configurations defines _where_ the pipeline is executed.
Hop comes supports a number of different runtime engines, each of which will be described in more detail in this section.
Each run configuration comes with its own set of parameters and configuration options, all of which are stored as Hop Metadata.

== Choosing a Run Configuration

When starting a new transformation click **New** next to 'Pipeline run configuration'.
All run configurations have a name, description and an engine type, each engine type has its own set of configuration options.

Once created, run configurations are available from the 'Pipeline run configuration' list and are ready to use.

|Name|The name you want to use for this pipeline run configuration.
|Description|A description you want to use for this pipeline run configuration (optional).
|Engine type a|
The available engine types are:

* *Beam DataFlow pipeline engine*: this configuration runs pipelines on Google DataFlow over Apache Beam
* *Beam Direct pipeline engine*: this configuration runs pipelines on the direct Beam runner (mainly for testing purposes)
* *Beam Flink pipeline engine*: this configuration runs pipelines on Apache Flink over Apache Beam
* *Beam Spark pipeline engine*: this configuration runs pipelines on Apache Spark over Apache Beam
* *Local pipeline engine*: this configuration runs pipelines locally in the native Hop engine
* *Remote pipeline engine*: this configuration runs pipelines in the native Hop engine on a remote machine

TIP: Check the link:https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/[Beam Capability Matrix] to help you decide which Beam engine works best for your pipeline.

=== Variables Tab

This tab allows Hop developers to specify a set of variables to be used in the run configurations.
