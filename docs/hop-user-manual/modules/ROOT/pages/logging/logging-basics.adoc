= Logging

Every workflow or pipeline as well as the tools generate logging.
Most of the obvious logging is available in the form of logging text.

== Levels

=== Descriptions

The amount of text logging generated depends on the logging level which is used when executing a workflow or pipeline:

|===
|Level |Description

|NONE
|No logging is generated

|ERROR
|Only errors are reported

|MINIMAL
|The bare essential, nothing more

|BASIC
|The standard logging which tries to be concise and informative

|DETAILED
|More logging information about what happens behind the scenes is reported

|DEBUG
|A lot of information is produced, often with specific values being reported

|ROWLEVEL
|Values are reported on an individual row level

|===

=== Runtime levels

The logging level can be specified when executing using hop-run or in the Hop GUI.
It is also possible to use the debug plugin to set custom logging levels on a transform:

image::logging/custom-logging-actions.png[Transform action - show logging options, 35% , align="left"]

You can set a custom logging level for this particular transform and only for certain rows of data:

image::logging/custom-transform-logging-level.png[Setting a custom transform logging level, 60%, align="left"]

You can do likewise for a workflow:

image::logging/custom-action-logging-level.png[Setting a custom action logging level, 35%, align="left"]

== Hop GUI logging

The logging file of the Hop GUI is saved in the `audit/` folder (or in the folder set by `HOP_AUDIT_FOLDER`) in the `hopui.log` file.

== Tools logging

If you want to send logging of tools like hop-run or hop-conf to a logging file you need to do this simply by piping the text stream to a file.

== Logging plugins 

=== Actions 

==== Write to log 

The Write to log acction writes a specific string to the Hop logging system.

Check the xref:../workflow/actions/writetolog.adoc[Write To Log] page for more details. 

=== Metadata Types

==== Pipeline Log 

A pipeline log allows to log the activity of a pipeline with another pipeline.

Check the xref:../metadata-types/pipeline-log.adoc[pipeline log] and xref:../logging/logging-reflection.adoc[logging reflection] pages for more details. 

==== Workflow Log

Allows to log the activity of a workflow with a pipeline.

Check the xref:../metadata-types/workflow-log.adoc[workflow log] and xref:../logging/logging-reflection.adoc[logging reflection] pages for more details. 

=== Perspectives 

==== Neo4j 

Hop can write execution logs for workflows and pipelines to a Neo4j database. 

Check xref:../hop-gui/perspective-neo4j.adoc[Neo4j Perspective] page for more details.

=== Transforms 

==== Write to Log

This transform writes information to the Hop logging system.

Check the xref:../pipeline/transforms/writetolog.adoc[Write To Log] page for more details. 

=== External plugins 

The xref:../plugins/external-plugins.adoc[external] hop-plugins repository contains the `Send information using syslog` action and `Send message to syslog` transforms.
