:description: Well-designed Hop solutions never use hard coded values. Hop offers variables on the global, project and environment levels, and allows workflows and parameters to provide parameters, to set and read variables in runtime etc.

= Variables

== What is a Hop variable?

You don't want to hardcode your solutions.
It's simply bad form to hardcode host names, user names, passwords, directories and so on.
Variables allow your solutions to adapt to a changing environment.
If for example the database server is different when developing than it is when running in production, you set it as a variable.

== How do I use a variable?

In the Hop user interface all places where you can enter a variable have a '$' symbol to the right of the input field:

image::variable-indicator.png[The variable indicator]

You can specify a variable by referencing it like this:

[source]
${VARIABLE_NAME}

*TIP* _You can see a list of defined variables by using CTRL-SPACE (CMD-SPACE on OSX) in the input field.
This helper will insert a selected variable into the input field._

Please note that you don't *have* to specify a variable in these places and that you can combine the variable with other information like:

[source]
${ENVIRONMENT_HOME}/input/source-file.txt

== Hexadecimal values

In rare cases you might have a need to enter non-character values as separators in 'binary' text files with for example a zero byte as a separator.
In those scenarios you can use a special 'variable' format:

[source]
$[<hexadecimal value>]

A few examples:

|===
|Value |Meaning

|`$[00]`
|A single byte with decimal value 0

|`$[FFFF]`
|Two bytes with decimal value 65535

|`$[CEA3]`
|The 2 bytes representing UTF-8 character Σ

|`$[e28ca8]`
|The 3 bytes representing UTF-8 character ⌨

|`$[f09d849e]`
|The 4 bytes representing UTF-8 character 𝄞
|===

== How can I define variables?

Variables can be defined and set in all the places where it makes sense:

* in hop-config.json when it applies to the installation
* in an environment configuration file when it concerns a specific lifecycle environment
* In a xref:projects/projects-environments.adoc[project]
* In a xref:pipeline/pipeline-run-configurations/pipeline-run-configurations.adoc[pipeline run configuration]
* As a default parameter value in a pipeline or workflow
* Using the xref:pipeline/transforms/setvariable.adoc[Set Variables] transform in a pipeline
* Using the xref:workflow/actions/setvariables.adoc[Set Variables] action in a workflow
* When executing with xref:hop-run/index.adoc[Hop run]

== Locality

Variables are local to the place where they are defined.
This means that setting them in a certain place means that it's going to be inherited from that place on.
This also means that's important to know where variables can be set and used and the hierarchy behind it.

== Hierarchy

.Variables Hierarchy
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
|Place|Inheritance
|System properties|Inherited by the JVM and all other places in Hop
|Environment|Inherited by run configurations
|Run Configurations|Pipeline run configurations are inherited by the environment
|Pipeline|Inherited by the pipeline run configuration
|Workflow|Inherited by the workflow run configuration
|Metadata objects|Inherited by the place where it is loaded
|===

=== System properties

All system properties defined in the Hop configuration file 'hop-config.json' are available as variables as well as all Java system properties.
You can define new system properties in the Hop GUI using the system properties editor:

image::system-properties-menu.png[The system properties menu in Hop GUI]

You can also edit the 'hop-config.json' file manually:

[source,json]
{
  "systemProperties" : {
    "MY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY" : "SomeValue"
  }
}

You can also use the hop-config command line tool to define system properties:

[source,bash]
sh hop-config.sh -s MY_SYSTEM_PROPERTY=SomeValue

System properties get set in Java Virtual Machine that Hop is running.
This means that you should limit yourself to only those variables which are really system specific.

=== Environment Variables

As you can read in the documentation regarding environments you can set variables there as well.
This helps you configure folders and other things which are environment specific.

You can set those in the Environment settings dialog or using the command line:

[source,bash]
sh hop-config.sh -e MyEnvironment -em -ev VARIABLE1=value1

=== Run Configurations

You can specify variables here to make a pipeline or workflow run in an engine agnostic way.
As an example you can have the same pipeline run on Hadoop with Spark and specify an input directory using hdfs:// and on Google DataFlow using gs://

=== Workflow

You can define variables in a workflow either with the "Set Variables", "JavaScript" actions or by defining parameters.
Parameters are variables which have a description and can have a default value.

=== Pipelines

You can define variables in a pipeline either with the "Set Variables", "JavaScript" transforms or by defining parameters.
Parameters are variables which have a description and can have a default value.

*IMPORTANT* Since in pipelines all transforms run in parallel you should never try to set and use the same variable in the same pipeline.

== Available global variables

The following variables are available in Hop through the xref:hop-gui/perspective-configuration.adoc[configuration perspective]. If you have the menu toolbar enabled in the configuration perspective's xref:hop-gui/perspective-configuration.adoc#_general[General] tab, these variables are also available through `Tools -> Edit config variables`.

Otherwise by default a NULL is returned when all values are NULL.
|HOP_AGGREGATION_MIN_NULL_IS_VALUED|N|Set this variable to Y to set the minimum to NULL if NULL is within an aggregate.
Otherwise by default NULL is ignored by the MIN aggregate and MIN is set to the minimum value that is not NULL.

|HOP_LENIENT_STRING_TO_NUMBER_CONVERSION|N|System wide flag to allow lenient string to number conversion for backward compatibility.
If this setting is set to "Y", an string starting with digits will be converted successfully into a number. (example: 192.168.1.1 will be converted into 192 or 192.168 or 192168 depending on the decimal and grouping symbol).
The default (N) will be to throw an error if non-numeric symbols are found in the string.
|HOP_LICENSE_HEADER_FILE|-|This is the name of the variable which when set should contains the path to a file which will be included in the serialization of pipelines and workflows

|HOP_PLUGIN_CLASSES||A comma delimited list of classes to scan for plugin annotations
|HOP_ROWSET_GET_TIMEOUT|50|The name of the variable that optionally contains an alternative rowset get timeout (in ms).
This only makes a difference for extremely short lived pipelines.
|HOP_ROWSET_PUT_TIMEOUT|50|The name of the variable that optionally contains an alternative rowset put timeout (in ms).
This only makes a difference for extremely short lived pipelines.
