[[DisableUiElements]]
= Customize the UI

== Disable UI elements

Apache Hop has a system to disable UI elements and perspective.
This could be useful for managed instances where the user should not have full control of Hop.

You can add the following file to the Hop installation folder or your Hop Config location (default: `/hop/config`). The final list of disabled UI elements is the aggregation of both files. This allows you to remove GUI elements on a global level (Hop Installation) and extend it with specific excludes for specific users (on config level).

Add the following file: +
disabledGuiElements.xml

[source,xml]
