= If You Know Kettle (Pentaho Data Integration)

== Why Hop?

Hop wants to allow data engineers to be able to deliver high quality work, deliver that work fast and integrated with bleeding edge technology.

We want Hop to be completely open source, and are eager to hear your feedback on our https://chat.project-hop.org[chat] and just as eager to see your bug tickets and feature request in https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HOP/issues[JIRA].

As an open source first project, we started the https://www.apache.org/[Apache Software Foundation] https://incubator.apache.org/[incubation] process in September 2020 and graduated as and ASF https://projects.apache.org/[top level project] in December 2021.

Check our https://hop.apache.org/docs/qa/[Q&A] for more information on why Hop was created and what the project is all about.

== Concepts

A couple of things have been renamed to align Apache Hop with modern data processing platforms.

**_A lot_** has changed behind the scenes, but don't worry, if you're familiar with Kettle/PDI, you'll feel right at home immediately.

|===
|Kettle|Hop|Difference
|Spoon|Hop Gui|Spoon has been abandoned.
Hop Gui was written from scratch.
Check the xref:manual::getting-started/index.adoc[Getting Started guide] or the xref:manual::hop-gui/index.adoc[Hop Gui docs] to find out more.
|Transformation|Pipeline|No conceptual changes.
You'll develop pipelines just like you would develop a transformation, but a pipeline in Hop can run on different runtimes
|Job|Workflow|No conceptual changes.
You'll develop a workflow just like you would develop a job, but a workflow in Hop can run on different runtimes
|Step|Transform|No conceptual changes.
The underlying code has changed and the dialogs have been updated, but you'll feel right at home.
|Job Entry|Action|No conceptual changes.
The underlying code has changed and the dialogs have been updated, but you'll feel right at home.
|Metastore|Metadata|All metadata objects in Hop are stored as metadata.
This happens behind the scenes.
Except for increased usability, as a Hop developer, you'll hardly notice.
|Carte|Hop Server|Again, smooth sailing.
A lot has changed behind the scenes, but you'll hardly notice.
Check the xref:manual::hop-server/index.adoc[docs]
|Pan/Kitchen/(Maitre)|Hop Run|Kitchen and Pan depended on the Spoon GUI code.
With the rewrite of Spoon to Hop Gui, we've recreated the command line tools.
We believe this now is more consistent while providing more options and being easier to use at the same time.
Check the xref:manual::hop-run/index.adoc[docs]
|JNDI|gone|jndi in Kettle/PDI is based on an open source project that hasn't been updated in about a decade.
As there was no reason to keep this functionality in Hop, it was abandoned.
|Repositories|gone|Code repositories belong in a VCS these days.
We've abandoned the file and database (and PDI EE repositories) repositories, but implemented Git integration instead.
|-|Projects, Environments, Run Config|The https://github.com/mattcasters/kettle-environment[Kettle Environments Plugin] has been integrated and significantly extended.
Hop now has integrated functionality to support your projects, environments and run configurations.
Check the xref:manual::projects/projects-environments.adoc[docs].
|-|Hop Config|This is a new command line tool to configure your projects, environments and run configurations.

== Apache Beam

https://beam.apache.org[Apache Beam] has been deeply integrated in Hop.
Beam allows us to run pipelines directly on

* https://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark]
* https://flink.apache.org[Apache Flink]
* https://cloud.google.com/dataflow[Google Dataflow]
