# Hop

The Hop Orchestration Platform aims to facilitate all aspects of data and metadata orchestration.

## Trying Hop 

Hop is work in progress. After building, the UI can be started, but a lot of things may be broken. 

There are various things you can do to help Hop moving forward as fast as possible: 

- log bugs, request features in the [Hop JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HOP)
- asking questions to the mailing list or [mattermost](https://chat.project-hop.org/hop/channels/dev)
- help with documentation (lot of opportunities)
- help fixing some [sonar issues](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=hop)
- spread the word
