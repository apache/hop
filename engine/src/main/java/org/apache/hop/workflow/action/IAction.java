/**
 * IAction is the main Java interface that a plugin implements. The responsibilities of the implementing class
 * are listed below:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Maintain action settings</b><br/>
 * The implementing class typically keeps track of action settings using private fields with corresponding getters
 * and setters. The dialog class implementing IActionDialog is using the getters and setters to copy the user
 * supplied configuration in and out of the dialog.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The following interface method also falls into the area of maintaining settings:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#clone()"><code>Object clone()</code></a> <br/>
 * This method is called when a action is duplicated in HopGui. It needs to return a deep copy of this action
 * object. It is essential that the implementing class creates proper deep copies if the action configuration is
 * stored in modifiable objects, such as lists or custom helper objects. This interface does not extend Cloneable, but
 * the implementing class will provide a similar method due to this interface.</li><br/>
 * <li><b>Serialize action settings</b><br>
 * The plugin needs to be able to serialize its settings to XML. The interface methods are as
 * follows:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#getXml()"><code>String getXml()</code></a><br/>
 * This method is called by PDI whenever a action needs to serialize its settings to XML. It is called when saving a
 * workflow in HopGui. The method returns an XML string, containing the serialized settings. The string contains a series of
 * XML tags, typically one tag per setting. The helper class org.apache.hop.core.xml.XmlHandler is typically used to
 * construct the XML string.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#loadXml(org.w3c.dom.Node)">
 * <code>void loadXml(...)</code></a></br> This method is called by PDI whenever a action needs to read its
 * settings from XML. The XML node containing the action's settings is passed in as an argument. Again, the helper
 * class org.apache.hop.core.xml.XmlHandler is typically used to conveniently read the settings from the XML node.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <quote>Hint: When developing plugins, make sure the serialization code is in sync with the settings available from
 * the action dialog. When testing a plugin in HopGui, PDI will internally first save and load a copy of the
 * workflow.</quote></li><br/>
 * <li><b>Provide access to dialog class</b><br/>
 * PDI needs to know which class will take care of the settings dialog for the action. The interface method
 * getDialogClassName() must return the name of the class implementing the IActionDialog.</li></br>
 * <li><b>Provide information about possible outcomes</b><br/>
 * A action may support up to three types of outgoing hops: true, false, and unconditional. Sometimes it does not
 * make sense to support all three possibilities. For instance, if the action performs a task that does not produce a
 * boolean outcome, like the dummy action, it may make sense to suppress the true and false outgoing hops. There are
 * other actions, which carry an inherent boolean outcome, like the "file exists" action for instance. It may
 * make sense in such cases to suppress the unconditional outgoing hop.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The action plugin class must implement two methods to indicate to PDI which outgoing hops it supports:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#evaluates()"><code>boolean evaluates()</code></a><br/>
 * This method must return true if the action supports the true/false outgoing hops. If the action does not
 * support distinct outcomes, it must return false.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#isUnconditional()"><code>boolean isUnconditional()</code></a><br/>
 * This method must return true if the action supports the unconditional outgoing hop. If the action does not
 * support the unconditional hop, it must return false.</li><br/>
 * <li><b>Execute a action task</b><br/>
 * The class implementing IAction executes the actual action task by implementing the following method:
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#execute(org.apache.hop.core.Result, int)"><code>Result execute(..)</code></a><br/>
 * The execute() method is going to be called by PDI when it is time for the action to execute its logic. The
 * arguments are a result object, which is passed in from the previously executed action and an integer number
 * indicating the distance of the action from the start entry of the workflow.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The action should execute its configured task, and report back on the outcome. A action does that by calling
 * certain methods on the passed in <a href="../../core/Result.html">Result</a> object:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <code>prev_result.setNrErrors(..)</code><br/>
 * The action needs to indicate whether it has encountered any errors during execution. If there are errors,
 * setNrErrors must be called with the number of errors encountered (typically this is 1). If there are no errors,
 * setNrErrors must be called with an argument of 0.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <code>prev_result.setResult(..)</code><br/>
 * The action must indicate the outcome of the task. This value determines which output hops can be followed next. If
 * a action does not support evaluation, it need not call prev_result.setResult().<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Finally, the passed in prev_result object must be returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
