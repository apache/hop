 * Workaround for stream close issue under Java 8.
 * <p>
 * The problem is: during Workbook writing to stream, Apache POI closes output stream itself. After that, ExcelWrite
 * closes this stream also because it was open in the ExcelWriter. But Java 8 contains bug
 * https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8042377 with second stream closing. As result, second close() throws
 * exception.
