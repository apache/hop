/**
 * Defines methods needed for partitioner plugins. The main responsibilities are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Maintain partitioner settings</b><br/>
 * The implementing class typically keeps track of partitioner settings using private fields with corresponding getters
 * and setters. The dialog class implementing ITransformDialog is using the getters and setters to copy the user
 * supplied configuration in and out of the dialog.
 * <p>
 * The following interface method also falls into the area of maintaining settings:
 * <p>
 * <i><a href="#clone()">public Object clone()</a></i>
 * <p>
 * This method is called when a transform containing partitioning configuration is duplicated in HopGui. It needs to return a
 * deep copy of this partitioner object. It is essential that the implementing class creates proper deep copies if the
 * configuration is stored in modifiable objects, such as lists or custom helper objects. The copy is created by first
 * calling super.clone(), and deep-copying any fields the partitioner may have declared.
 * <p>
 * <i><a href="#getInstance()">public IPartitioner getInstance()</a></i>
 * <p>
 * This method is required to return a new instance of the partitioner class, with the plugin id and plugin description
 * inherited from the instance this function is called on.</li>
 * <li><b>Serialize partitioner settings</b><br/>
 * The plugin needs to be able to serialize its settings to XML. The interface methods are as
 * follows.
 * <p>
 * <i><a href="#getXml()">public String getXml()</a></i>
 * <p>
 * This method is called by Apache Hop whenever the plugin needs to serialize its settings to XML. It is called when saving a
 * pipeline in HopGui. The method returns an XML string, containing the serialized settings. The string contains a
 * series of XML tags, typically one tag per setting. The helper class org.apache.hop.core.xml.XmlHandler is typically
 * used to construct the XML string.
 * <p>
 * <i><a href="#loadXml(org.w3c.dom.Node)">public void loadXml(...)</a></i>
 * <p>
 * This method is called by Apache Hop whenever a plugin needs to read its settings from XML. The XML node containing the
 * plugin's settings is passed in as an argument. Again, the helper class org.apache.hop.core.xml.XmlHandler is
 * typically used to conveniently read the settings from the XML node.
 * <p>
 * <i><a href="#getDialogClassName()">public String getDialogClassName()</i></a> </li>
 * <li><b>Partition incoming rows during runtime</b><br/>
 * The class implementing IPartitioner executes the actual logic that distributes the rows to available partitions.
 * <p>
 * This method is called with the row structure and the actual row as arguments. It must return the partition this row
 * will be sent to. The total number of partitions is available in the inherited field nrPartitions, and the return
 * value must be between 0 and nrPartitions-1.
 * <p>
 * <i><a href="">public int getPartition(...)</a></i></li>
 * </ul>
