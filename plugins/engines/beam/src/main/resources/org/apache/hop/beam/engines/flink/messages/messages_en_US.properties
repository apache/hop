BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsAutoWatermarkInterval.Label=Auto watermark interval
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsAutoWatermarkInterval.ToolTip=The interval in milliseconds for automatic watermark emission.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsCheckpointInterval.Label=Checkpointing interval
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsCheckpointInterval.ToolTip=The interval in milliseconds at which to trigger checkpoints of the running pipeline. Default: No checkpointing.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsCheckpointMode.Label=Checkpointing mode
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsCheckpointMode.ToolTip=The checkpointing mode that defines consistency guarantee.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsCheckpointTimeout.Label=Checkpointing timeout (ms)
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsCheckpointTimeout.ToolTip=The maximum time in milliseconds that a checkpoint may take before being discarded.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsDisableMetrics.Label=Disable metrics
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsDisableMetrics.ToolTip=Disable Beam metrics in Flink Runner
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsExecutionModeForBatch.Label=Batch execution mode
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsExecutionModeForBatch.ToolTip=Flink mode for data exchange of batch pipelines. Set this to BATCH_FORCED if pipelines get blocked, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10672
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsExternalizedCheckpointsEnabled.Label=Disable externalized checkpoints
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsExternalizedCheckpointsEnabled.ToolTip=Enables or disables externalized checkpoints. Works in conjunction with CheckpointingInterval
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsFailOnCheckpointErrors.Label=Fail on checkpointing errors?
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsFailOnCheckpointErrors.ToolTip=Sets the expected behaviour for tasks in case that they encounter an error in their checkpointing procedure. If this is set to true, the task will fail on checkpointing error. If this is set to false, the task will only decline a the checkpoint and continue running. 
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsLatencyTrackingInterval.Label=Latency tracking interval
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsLatencyTrackingInterval.ToolTip=Interval in milliseconds for sending latency tracking marks from the sources to the sinks. Interval value <= 0 disables the feature.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsMaster.Label=The Flink master
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsMaster.ToolTip=Address of the Flink Master where the Pipeline should be executed. Can either be of the form \"host:port\" or one of the special values [local], [collection] or [auto].
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsMaxBundleSize.Label=Maximum bundle size
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsMaxBundleSize.ToolTip=The maximum number of elements in a bundle.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsMaxBundleTimeMills.Label=Maximum bundle time (ms)
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsMaxBundleTimeMills.ToolTip=The maximum time to wait before finalising a bundle (in milliseconds).
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsNumberOfRetries.Label=Number of execution retries
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsNumberOfRetries.ToolTip=Sets the number of times that failed tasks are re-executed. A value of zero effectively disables fault tolerance. A value of -1 indicates that the system default value (as defined in the configuration) should be used.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsObjectReuse.Label=Object re-use
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsObjectReuse.ToolTip=Sets the behavior of reusing objects.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsParallelism.Label=Parallelism
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsParallelism.ToolTip=The degree of parallelism to be used when distributing operations onto workers. If the parallelism is not set, the configured Flink default is used, or 1 if none can be found.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsPauseBetweenCheckpoints.Label=Minimum pause between checkpoints
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsPauseBetweenCheckpoints.ToolTip=The minimal pause in milliseconds before the next checkpoint is triggered.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsRetainExternalizedCheckpointsOnCancellation.Label=Retain externalized checkpoints on cancellation
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsRetainExternalizedCheckpointsOnCancellation.ToolTip=Sets the behavior of externalized checkpoints on cancellation.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsRetryDelay.Label=Execution retry delay (ms)
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsRetryDelay.ToolTip=Sets the delay in milliseconds between executions. A value of -1 indicates that the default value should be used.
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsShutdownSourcesAfterIdleMs.Label=Shutdown sources on final watermark
BeamEnginesFlink.OptionsShutdownSourcesAfterIdleMs.ToolTip=Shuts down sources which have been idle for the configured time of milliseconds. Once a source has been shut down, checkpointing is not possible anymore. Shutting down the sources eventually leads to pipeline shutdown (=Flink job finishes) once all input has been processed. Unless explicitly set, this will default to Long.MAX_VALUE when checkpointing is enabled and to 0 when checkpointing is disabled. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-2491 for progress on this issue.
