= XSD Validator

== Description

The XSD Validator action performs an XSD validation against data in a file or in an input field. XSD is short for link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)[XML Schema] Definition.

As such, there are 2 entities at work here:

* The XML you want to validate the layout for
* The XSD (Schema) file that describes what the XML file should look like.
