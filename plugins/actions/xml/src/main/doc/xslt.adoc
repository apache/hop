= XSL Transformation

== Description

The XSL Transformation action is designed to transform XML documents into other documents (XML or other format, such as HTML or plain text) using Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations or link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT[XSLT].

The original document is not changed; rather, a new document is created based on the content of the XML file.
