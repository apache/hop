= Http Get

== Description

Use the HTTP action to retrieve a file from a Web server using the HTTP protocol. This workflow action could be used to access data on partner Web sites. For example, the daily data export or daily list of customers is located at a specified Web site. Also, SaaS providers may give you a URL to locate a report. You can call that URL to retrieve an Excel file or zip file that contains the data. Salesforce requires that you use SOAP APIs to retrieve data.

If HTTP traffic is too heavy in your corporate environment, you may choose to use a proxy server with HTTP authentication.
