== Description

The Display Msgbox info action allow you to display a message box in a workflow. You can easily see where you are in the process. This workflow action is only available using the Graphical User Interface to execute the workflow.

The message box displays "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.

    Clicking on "OK" exits on the green hop
    Clicking on "Cancel" exits on the red hop

When the question cannot be asked (no Graphical User Interface), the action always exits on the green hop.
