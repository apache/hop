= Send Nagios check

== Description

The Send Nagios check action allows you to send passive checks to Nagios. You can send monitoring information e.g. about start and end processes within your workflow.

It needs the NCSA addon installed on the Nagios server (NSCA is a Linux/Unix daemon allows you to integrate passive alerts and checks from remote machines and applications with Nagios. Useful for processing security alerts, as well as redundant and distributed Nagios setups.)

More details and setup instructions for the Nagios NSCA addon can be found at the Nagios link:http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/passivechecks.html[Passive Checks documentation.]
