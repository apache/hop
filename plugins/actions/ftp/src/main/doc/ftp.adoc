= Get a file with FTP

== Description

Use the Get a File with FTP workflow action to retrieve one or more files from an FTP server. This workflow action does not "crawl" systems. It will not, for example, access a remote directory and go to other directories to find files that match a wildcard. This workflow retrieves files from one directory exclusively.
