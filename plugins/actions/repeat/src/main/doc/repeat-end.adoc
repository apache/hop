= End Repeat

== Description

This action allows you to a end repeating workflow which is executed by the Repeat action.
It leaves a flag in the parent workflow to signal it can stop repeating at the next opportunity.

*NOTE* The End Repeat action only works against its parent workflow when it's being executed by the Repeat action.

This action has no options.  It works as a "Success" action and clears possible previous errors.
