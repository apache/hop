|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform, this name has to be unique in a single pipeline.
|Sort directory|The directory in which the temporary files are stored in case when needed; the default is the standard temporary directory for the system
|TMP-file prefix|Choose an easily recognized prefix so you can identify the files when they show up in the temp directory.
|Sort size|The more rows you store in memory, the faster the sorting process because fewer temporary files must be used and less I/O is generated.
|Free memory threshold (in %)|If the sort algorithm finds that it has less available free memory than the indicated number, it will start to page data to disk.
|Compress TMP Files|Compresses temporary files when they are needed to complete the sort.
|Only pass unique rows?|Enable if you want to pass unique rows only to the output stream(s).
|Fields table|Specify the fields and direction (ascending/descending) to sort. You can specify whether to perform a case sensitive sort (optional)
|Get Fields|Click to retrieve a list of all fields coming in on the stream(s).
