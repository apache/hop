= Web services lookup

== Description

This transform performs a Web Services lookup using the Web Services Description Language (WSDL).

== Options

[width="90%", options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Transform Name|Name of the transform this name has to be unique in a single pipeline.
|URL|The base URL pointing to the WSDL document that will be retrieved
|Load (button)|The load button loads the WSDL at the specified URL and tries to automatically populate the input and output tabs and fields.
NOTE: If this doesn't work, you can still try to manually specify the input and output fields using the "Add Input" and "Add Output" buttons.
|The number of rows per call|
The number of rows to send with each WSDL call
|Pass input data to output|
If you disable this, the input will be eaten and only the WSDL output will be passed along to the next steps.
v2.x/3.x compatibility mode
We improved the parsing engine of the 3.x engine dramatically.  For compatibility reasons, we kept the old engine around to make sure older steps would still work OK.
|Repeating element name|
Specify the name of the repeating element in the output XML (if any).
|HTTP authentication|
Here you can put the username and password if these are required for the web service.
|Proxy to use|
Here you can optionally put the proxy host and port information.
|Add Input / Add Output|
These buttons will allow you to manually specify the input and output specifications of the WSDL service.
Note: The data of the input fields can be escaped by the Calculator step and the function "Mask XML content from string A"
