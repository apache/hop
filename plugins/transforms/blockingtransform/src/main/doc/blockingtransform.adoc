= Blocking transform

== Description

The Blocking transform blocks all output until the very last row is received from the previous transform.

At that point, the last row is sent to the next transform or the complete input is sent off to the next transform. Use the Blocking transform for triggering plugins, stored procedures, Java scripts, ... or for synchronization purposes.
