= XSD Validator

== Description

The XSD Validator transform performs an XSD validation against data in a file or in an input field. XSD is short for link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)[XML Schema Definition].

As such, there are 2 entities at work here:

* The XML you want to validate the layout for
* The XSD (Schema) file that describes what the XML file should look like.

To make matters more complex, it's possible to store the XSD inside the XML itself.
