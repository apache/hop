= XML Join

== Description

The XML Join transform allows to add xml tags from one stream into a leading XML structure from a second stream. While the target stream must have only one row, since it represents a XML document, the other stream can consist of many rows and the tags from all rows will be added to the target document.

After the join only one row will be produced containing the fields of the target transform plus the result field of the join.

|Omit null values from XML result|Without checking this option, null values are added to the XML output as an empty element, for instance: <abc/>.
