= Text File Output

== Description

The Text file output transform is used to export data to text file format. This is commonly used to generate Comma Separated Values (CSV files) that can be read by spreadsheet applications.  It is also possible to generate fixed width files by setting lengths on the fields in the fields tab.

== Options

=== File Tab

The File tab is where you define basic properties about the file being created, such as:

[width="90%", options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Transform Name|Name of the transform this name has to be unique in a single pipeline.
|Filename|This field specifies the filename and location of the output text file.
|Run this as a command instead?|Enable to "pipe" the results into the command or script you specify. It can also be used for some database bulk loaders that can process the input from stdin. In this case set the filename to the script or binary to execute.
|Pass output to servlet|Enable this option to return the data via a web service instead writing into a file
|Create parent folder|Enable to create the parent folder
|Do not create file at start|Enable to avoid empty files when no rows are getting processed.
|Accept file name from field?|Enable to specify the file name(s) in a field in the input stream
|File name field|When the previous option is enabled, you can specify the field that will contain the filename(s) at runtime.
|Extension|Adds a point and the extension to the end of the filename. (.txt)
|Include transformnr in filename|If you run the transform in multiple copies (Launching several copies of a transform), the copy number is included in the filename, before the extension. (_0).
|Include partition nr in filename?|Includes the data partition number in the filename.
|Include date in filename|Includes the system date in the filename. (default _20041231).
|Include time in filename|Includes the system time in the filename. (default _235959).
|Specify Date time format|Enable to specify the date time format
|Date time format|Chose the date time format to append to the filename
|Add file name to rest|This adds all processed filenames to the internal result filename set to allow for further processing.
|Show filename(s)|This option shows a list of the files that will be generated.
|===


=== Content Tab

The content tab contains the following options for describing the content being read:

[width="90%", options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Append|Check this to append lines to the end of the specified file.
|Separator|Specify the character that separates the fields in a single line of text. Typically this is ; or a tab.
|Enclosure|A pair of strings can enclose some fields. This allows separator or enclosure characters in fields. The enclosure string is optional.
|Force the enclosure around fields?|This option forces all fields of an incoming string type (independent of the eventually changed field type within the Text File Output field definition) to be enclosed with the character specified in the Enclosure property above.
|Disable the enclosure fix?|When a string field contains an enclosure it gets enclosed and the enclose itself gets escaped. When a string field contains a separator, it gets enclosed. Check this option, if this logic is not wanted. It has also an extra performance burden since the strings are scanned for enclosures and separators. So when you are sure there is no such logic needed since your strings don't have these characters in there and you want to improve performance, un-check this option.
|Header|Enable this option if you want the text file to have a header row. (First line in the file).
|Footer|Enable this option if you want the text file to have a footer row. (Last line in the file). Note: Be careful to enable this option when in Append mode since it is not possible to strip footers from the file contents before appending new rows. There are use cases where this option is wanted, e.g. to have a footer after each run of a pipeline to separate sections within the file.
|Format|This can be either DOS or UNIX. UNIX files have lines are separated by linefeeds. DOS files have lines separated by carriage returns and line feeds.
The options are: CR+LF terminated (Windows, DOS) / LF terminated (Unix) / CR terminated / No new-line terminator
|Encoding|Specify the text file encoding to use. Leave blank to use the default encoding on your system. To use Unicode specify UTF-8 or UTF-16. On first use, Spoon will search your system for available encodings.
|Compression|Allows you to specify the type of compression, .zip or .gzip to use when compressing the output. Note: Only one file is placed in a single archive.
|Right pad fields|Add spaces to the end of the fields (or remove characters at the end) until they have the specified length.
|Fast data dump (no formatting)|Improves the performance when dumping large amounts of data to a text file by not including any formatting information.
|Split every ... rows|If this number N is larger than zero, split the resulting text-file into multiple parts of N rows.
|Add Ending line of file|Allows you to specify an alternate ending row to the output file.

=== Fields Tab

The fields tab is where you define properties for the fields being exported. The table below describes each of the options for configuring the field properties:

[width="90%", options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Name|The name of the field.
|Type|Type of the field can be either String, Date or Number.
|Format|The format mask to convert with. See Number Formats for a complete description of format symbols.
|Length a| The length option depends on the field type follows:

* Number - Total number of significant figures in a number
* String - total length of string
* Date - length of printed output of the string (e.g. . only gives back year)
|Precision a|The precision option depends on the field type as follows:

* Number - Number of floating point digits
* String - unused
* Date - unused
|Currency|Symbol used to represent currencies like $10,000.00 or E5.000,00
|Decimal|A decimal point can be a "." (10,000.00) or "," (5.000,00)
|Group|A grouping can be a "," (10,000.00) or "." (5.000,00)
|Trim type|The trimming method to apply on the string. Note: Trimming only works when there is no field length given.
|Null|If the value of the field is null, insert this string into the textfile
|Get|Click to retrieve the list of fields from the input fields stream(s)
|Minimal width|Alter the options in the fields tab in such a way that the resulting width of lines in the text file is minimal. So instead of save 0000001, we write 1, etc. String fields will no longer be padded to their specified length.

== Metadata Injection Support

All fields of this transform support metadata injection. You can use this transform with ETL Metadata Injection to pass metadata to your pipeline at runtime.
