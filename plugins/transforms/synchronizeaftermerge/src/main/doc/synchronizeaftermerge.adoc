= Synchronize after merge 

== Description

The Synchronize after merge transform can be used in conjunction with the Merge Rows (diff) pipeline transform.  The Merge Rows (diff) pipeline transform appends a Flag column to each row, with a value of "identical", "changed", "new" or "deleted". This flag column is then used by the Synchronize after merge pipeline transform to carry out updates/inserts/deletes on a connection table.

|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform.
|Connection|The database connection to which data is written
|Target schema|The name of the Schema for the table to which data is written. This is important for data sources that allow for table names with periods in them.
|Target table|Name of the table in which you want to do the insert/update/delete.
|Commit size|The number of rows to change before running a commit.
|Use batch update|
|Tablename is defined in a field|
|Key Lookup table|Allows you to specify a list of field values and comparators. You can use the following comparators: =, <>, <, <=, >, >=, LIKE, BETWEEN, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
|Update Fields|Allows you to specify all fields in the table you want to insert/update including the keys. Avoid updates on certain fields (e.g. primary keys or non-null constrained fields) by specifying N in the update column.
