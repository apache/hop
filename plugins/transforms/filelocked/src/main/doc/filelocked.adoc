= Check if file is locked

== Description

This transform tries to determine if a file is locked by an other process.  It does this by trying to move it to itself.  

== Options


* transform name: the transform name, unique in a pipeline
* Filename field: the name of the input field that will contain the names of the files during execution.
* Result fieldname: the name of the Boolean output field that will contain true or false depending on whether or not the file is locked or not.
* Add filename to result: check this if you want to add the checked file-names to the list of files in the pipelines result.
