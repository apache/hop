== FAQ
=== The HTTP client transform doesn't do anything

*Q*: The HTTP client transform doesn't do anything, how do I make it work?

*A*: The HTTP client transform needs to be triggered. Use a Row generator transform generating e.g. 1 empty row and link that with a hop to the HTTP client transform.

=== The HTTP client transform and SOAP

*Q*: Does the HTTP client support SOAP?

*A*: No, it just calls an URL with arguments. Future transforms may provide SOAP functionality, Work is underway on a WebService transform supporting WSDL.
