= Microsoft Excel output

== Description

The Excel Output transform allows you to write data to one or more Excel files. The following sections describe the features available for configuring the Excel output transform. 

This transform exports data to a Microsoft Excel 2003 spreadsheet file (xls). If you want to write to an xlsx file (Excel 2007 and above), check the Excel Writer transform.

|Option|Description
|transform name|The name of this transform in the pipeline workspace.
|Filename|The name of the spreadsheet file you are reading from.
|Create Parent folder|If checked, the parent folder will be created
|Do not create file at start|If checked, does not create the file until the end of the transform. This avoids to create empty files when no rows are in the data stream.
|Extension|The three-letter file extension to append to the file name.
|Include transformnr in filename|If you run the transform in multiple copies (launching several copies of a transform), the copy number is included in the file name, before the extension. (_0).
|Include date in file name|Includes the system date in the filename (_20101231).
|Include time in file name|Includes the system time (24-hour format) in the filename (_235959).
|Specify Date time format|If checked, the filename will include a date and time stamp that follows the selection you choose from the drop-down box. Selecting this option disables the previous two options.
|Date time format|Provide a specific date time format for the filename.
|Show file name(s)|Displays a list of the files that will be generated. This is a simulation and depends on the number of rows that will go into each file.
|Add filenames to result|Adds the filenames to the internal filename result set. This internal result set can be used later on, e.g. to process all created files.
