Delay.Description=Output each input row after a delay
Delay.Injection.Scaletime=Unit of waittime (milliseconds/seconds/minutes/hours)
Delay.Injection.Timeout=How long should we wait
Delay.Injection.TimeoutField=Field containing timeout value
Delay.Injection.ScaleTimeFromField=Use a field to determine the time scale
Delay.Injection.ScaleTimeField=Field containing time scale value
Delay.Log.LineNumber=Linenr {0}
Delay.Log.TimeOut=Let''s wait now for {0} {1} ...
Delay.Log.TimeOutWithScale=Waiting {0} {1} (total {2} ms)
