= Switch / Case

== Description

What this transform does is implement the Switch/Case statement found in popular programming languages like Java.

In our case we route rows of data to one or more target transforms based on the value encountered in a certain field.

|Option|Description
|Transform name|The name that uniquely identifies the transform.
|Field name to switch|The field name that contains the value to use as a bases for the row routing.
|Use string contains comparison|If checked, the comparison will be true if the value is found anywhere in the field being tested. Unchecked and the value has to exactly match the field.
|Case value data type|The data type of the values specified in this dialog
|Case value conversion mask|The conversion mask of the values specified in this dialog (numeric / date values)
|Case value decimal symbol|The decimal symbol of the values specified in this dialog (numeric values)
|Case value grouping symbol|The grouping symbol of the values specified in this dialog (numeric values)
|Case values|Here you can specify a value-target transform pair, one per row.
To specify a null value, simply leave the value column blank while entering a target transform.
Please note that it is possible to specify the same target transform more than once.
|Default target transform|All the rows that don't match any of the case values above are sent to this target transform.
