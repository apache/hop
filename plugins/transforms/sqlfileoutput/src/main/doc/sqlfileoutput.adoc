|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform.
|Connection a|
	
* Connection : select the database for which you want to generate the SQL.  The information in the connection is used to select the appropriate dialect.
* Target schema : the schema of the table to generate the SQL for
* Target table : the name of the table to generate the SQL for

|Output file a|
* Add create table statement : check this if you want the "CREATE TABLE" statement to be included in the generated SQL
* Add truncate table statement: check this if the table is expected to exist and you want the "TRUNCATE TABLE" statement to be included in the generated SQL. Note that this could also be a "DELETE FROM" statement, depending on the database dialect.
* Start new line for each statement : Enable this to increase the readability of the file
* Filename : the filename (without file extension)
* Create parent folder : if you want the parent folder of the specified file to be created if it doesn't exist already.
* Do not open create at start : if you don't want an empty file in case there are no input rows
* Extension : the required file extension ("sql" by default)
* Include transformnr in filename : includes the transform number (when running in multiple copies) in the output filename
* Include date in filename : includes the date in the output filename with format yyyyMMdd (20081231)
* Include time in filename : includes the date in the output filename with format HHmmss (235959)
* Append : append the generated SQL to the existing file
* Split every ... rows : limits the size of a single file by starting a new one every ... rows.
* Show filenames : hit this button to see the complete filename after assembly of the various parts (filename, extension, transformnr, date and time)
* Add File to result: Adds the filenames written to the result of this pipeline.  A unique list is being kept in memory that can be used in the next workflow action in a workflow, for example in another pipeline.
