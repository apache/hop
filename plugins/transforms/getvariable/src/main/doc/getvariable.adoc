= Get variables

== Description

This transform allows you to get the value of a variable. This transform can return rows or add values to input rows.

For example, you can specify: ${java.io.tmpdir}/hop/tempfile.txt and it will be expanded to /tmp/hop/tempfile.txt on Unix-like systems.

See also the Set Variables transform.
To convert the Variable into a data type other than String use Select Values - Meta Data tab.
To get system values, including command line arguments, use the Get System Info transform.
