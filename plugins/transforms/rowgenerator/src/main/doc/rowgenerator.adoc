= Row Generator

== Description

This transform outputs a specified number of rows. By default, the rows are empty; however they can contain a number of static fields. This transform is used primarily for testing purposes. It may be useful for generating a fixed number of rows, for example, you want exactly 12 rows for 12 months. Sometimes you may use Generate Rows to generate one row that is an initiating point for your pipeline. For example, you might generate one row that contains two or three field values that you might use to parameterize your SQL and then generate the real rows.
