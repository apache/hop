|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform; This name has to be unique in a single pipeline
|Connection|Select a database connection for the lookup
|SQL field name|Specify the field that contains the SQL to execute
|Number of rows to return|Specify the number of records to return. 0 means, return all rows
|Outer Join|- false: don't return rows where nothing is found  - true: at least return one source row, the rest is NULL
|Replace variables|In case you want to use variables in the SQL, e.g. ${table_name}, this option needs to be checked.
|Query only on parameters change|If your SQL statements do not change a lot, check this option to reduce the number of physical database queries.
|Template SQL|In Hop meta and data are separate so you have to specify the meta part in template SQL (field name and type).
I mean any statement that returns the same row structure.
