= Add value fields changing sequence

== Description

This transform simply adds a sequence value which resets each time a value changes in the list of specified fields.

== Options

Here are the options for the transform:

* transform name : the name of the transform, needs to be unique in a pipeline
* Result field: the name of the output field, the sequence
* Start at value: the number to start at each time
* Increment by: the value to increase at each row in the same group
* Init sequence if value of following fields change: you can specify a list of fields here.  If a value in one or more of these fields changes compared to the previous rows, the sequence will be reset to the start value.
