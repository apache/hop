= Append Streams

== Description

The "Append streams" transform reads the data from two transforms, only processing the second stream after the first is finished.
As always, the row layout for the input data coming from both transforms has to be identical: the same row lengths, the same data types, the same fields at the same field indexes in the row.

*Important*: If you don't care about the order in which the output rows occur, you can use any transform to create a union of 2 or more data streams.
