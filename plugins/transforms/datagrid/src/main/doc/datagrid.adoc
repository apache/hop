= Data Grid

== Description

The Data Grid transform allows you to enter a static list of rows in a grid.  This is usually done for testing, reference or demo purposes.

== Options

[width="90%, options="header"]
|===
|Meta tab|specify the field metadata (output specification) of the data
|Data Tab|contains the data.  Everything is entered in String format so make sure you use the correct format masks in the metadata tab.
|===

== Metadata Injection Support
All fields of this transform support metadata injection. You can use this transform with ETL Metadata Injection to pass metadata to your pipeline at runtime.

== Limitations
It is not yet possible to insert columns in between 2 existing one or in general re-order the fields in the metadata tab.

If you plan to do this, make sure to copy the data section first to a spreadsheet (Select all rows and copy/paste the whole grid), change the data and copy it back into the data section.
