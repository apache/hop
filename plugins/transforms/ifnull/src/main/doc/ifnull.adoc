= If Null


== Description

The transform "If field value is null" is able to replace nulls by a given value either by:

1. Processing the complete row with all fields
2. Processing the complete row but only for specific field types (Number, String, Date etc.)
3. Processing the complete row but only for specific fields by name

== Metadata Injection Support

All fields of this transform support metadata injection. You can use this transform with Metadata Injection to pass metadata to your pipeline at runtime.
