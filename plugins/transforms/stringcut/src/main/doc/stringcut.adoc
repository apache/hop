|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform.
|In stream field|Name of the field whose substring to cut.
|Out stream field|When a field name is given here, the transform creates a new field with the substring. Otherwise the original field gets replaced by the substring.
|Cut from|Designate where to begin cutting the substring. This value is 0-based, thus the first character in a string is 0.
|Cut to|Designate where to end cutting the substring. This value is exclusive (1-based), so using a 1 includes the first character. The maximum length of the new string is Cut to minus Cut from.

== Metadata Injection Support
