# When stopping the running hop-server container with 'docker stop' it ended up with an timeout
# and an exitcode > 0 because signals are not catched correctly.
# It was not possible to end the container gracefully with Ctrl-C when it was started without -d 
# option which might be annoying on a gratefull exit. Therefore this script ( run.sh ) 
# that catches signals coming from the docker host is introduced.
